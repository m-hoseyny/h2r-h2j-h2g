These records are maintained by government agencies responsible for immigration and naturalization, such as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or similar bodies in other countries. In many jurisdictions, these records are accessible to the public through official databases, archives, or by requesting copies from the relevant government office.\n\nHowever, access to naturalization records may be subject to certain restrictions. For example, in the United States, naturalization records are typically sealed for a period of 75 years after the date of naturalization, making them unavailable to the public during that time. Additionally, some records may be withheld if they contain sensitive or confidential information, such as details about an individual's criminal history or national security concerns.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may need to submit a formal request to obtain copies of naturalization records, and there may be associated fees or processing times. While these records are public in principle, their availability can vary depending on the country, the specific records in question, and the legal framework governing access to such information.","dids":["1020327","1034183","1139571","1158886","1175024","1333480","1381453","1414114","1414120","1605854","1605857","1622747","1714917","1827512","188246","2339898","2607127","2607128","2607129","2607130","2607131","2607132","2647769","2838462","3008750","3185119","3878669","3978767","3978774","4016311","4016314","4016317","4065323","4138534","4188880","4281690","4344309","4556932","4556933","45662","4908953","4908957","5340997","5597936","5740854","5740859","587451","5888570","590926","590927","590929","5913890","6180228","6264715","6277578","640767","640772","6515917","6543413","6602616","6688737","6688738","6688741","6688742","6688743","6705133","6803015","7008458","7039665","7098341","7186713","723681","7300641","7395195","7624168","7845081","7896999","7987538","7987541","7987542","8010558","8010559","8010560","8010561","8010562","8010564","8010566","8017141","8052286","8059826","8177749","8246990","8336161","836559","8379423","8534117","958495"]}

On average, most brides can expect to spend between $200 and $1,000 on alterations. Simple changes such as hemming, adjusting the bustle, or taking in the waist typically fall within the lower end of this range, costing anywhere from $50 to $200. More intricate modifications, such as adding a train, adjusting the neckline, or reshaping the bodice, can increase the cost significantly, often reaching $500 to $1,000 or more. It's important to note that some tailors may charge by the hour, with rates ranging from $30 to $50 per hour, so the total cost will depend on the time and skill required. To get an accurate estimate, it's best to consult with a professional bridal alterations specialist and provide them with a detailed list of desired changes.","dids":["1156867","1560504","1839669","1839675","1880177","1880178","1880181","2042918","2042920","2042922","2042923","2042924","2338382","2338383","2338384","2338385","2477446","2545998","2545999","2546000","2546001","2546002","2546003","2546004","2546005","2546007","2566998","3304358","3304359","3304361","3304362","3304365","4007103","4007105","4007106","4007107","4007108","4007109","4748997","5207325","5207327","5207328","5207329","5301402","5301403","5301404","5301406","5497272","5627231","5642104","5642107","5691600","6168275","6168277","6168517","6168520","6180503","6180504","6330618","6502207","6990782","7367870","7367872","7367873","7509248","7509249","7509250","7509251","7509252","7509253","7562284","8241222","8261977","8261978"]}

Elevated body temperature, particularly when it exceeds 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) for an extended period, may affect the developing embryo by interfering with cellular development and metabolic processes. This is especially concerning during the first trimester, when the embryo is most vulnerable to developmental disruptions.\n\nWhile fever itself is not guaranteed to lead to miscarriage, it can be a symptom of an underlying infection, such as a urinary tract infection, flu, or other viral illnesses, which may pose greater risks to pregnancy. Infections during early pregnancy can sometimes lead to complications, including miscarriage, preterm labor, or birth defects, depending on the type and severity of the illness.\n\nIt is important for pregnant individuals to monitor their temperature and seek medical attention if they experience a fever, especially in the first trimester.

which stands for Bone Marrow Transplant, is a medical procedure used to replace damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells. This treatment is often used to treat various life-threatening diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and certain genetic disorders. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones that produces blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. When this marrow is damaged due to disease, infection, or chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant can help restore the body's ability to produce healthy blood cells.\n\nThere are two main types of bone marrow transplants: autologous, where the patient's own stem cells are used, and allogeneic, where stem cells are donated by a genetically matched donor. The process typically involves high-dose chemotherapy or radiation to destroy the diseased marrow, followed by the infusion of healthy stem cells. Recovery can take several weeks to months, and patients often require close medical monitoring to manage potential complications such as graft-versus-host disease or infection.

Etruscans were an ancient civilization that thrived in what is now central Italy during the first millennium BCE. They are often considered the predecessors of the Roman Empire and played a significant role in shaping the culture, religion, and political systems that would later influence Roman society. The Etruscan civilization flourished in the region known as Etruria, which encompassed parts of modern-day Tuscany, Lazio, and Umbria.\n\nThe Etruscans were known for their advanced urban planning, impressive architecture, and intricate art. They built large cities with well-organized streets, public buildings, and fortified walls. Their tombs, often elaborate and richly decorated, provide insight into their beliefs about the afterlife. The Etruscans were also skilled in metallurgy, pottery, and the construction of large-scale structures like temples and theaters.\n\nReligiously, the Etruscans had a complex pantheon of gods and goddesses, and their religious practices heavily influenced early Roman beliefs. Divination was an important aspect of their culture, with priests known as \"augurs\" interpreting omens and signs to guide political and military decisions. They placed great importance on ritual and the supernatural, often consulting oracle priests to seek guidance from the gods.\n\nPolitically, the Etruscans established a system of government that combined monarchy, aristocracy, and oligarchy. Their rulers, known as \"king,\" held significant power, but their authority was often checked by a council of nobles. This political structure would later influence the development of the Roman Republic.\n\nAlthough the Etruscan civilization declined in the 4th century BCE, its legacy endured through the Romans, who adopted many of their customs, religious practices, and artistic traditions. The Etruscans remain a fascinating subject of study, offering a glimpse into the ancient world that helped shape the course of Western civilization.","dids":["1087310","1087311","1175612","1219224","1219231","1278921","1278926","1278929","1278930","1331148","1448528","1460907","1568658","1629037","1648244","1651653","1710883","1710884","1898444","1912872","1955507","1957753","1984785","2132090","2132420","2156101","2184701","2214980","2226645","2226651","2282917","2282923","2297409","2343233","2370501","2467756","2474195","2479538","2550805","2550806","2550807","2550809","2550810","2550811","2550812","2550813","2550814","2579338","2579341","259430","259432","259433","259434","259435","259436","2626097","2626098","2626099","2626100","2626101","2626106","2631821","2631822","2631823","2631825","2631826","2631827","2640471","2640473","2643868","2735729","2735732","2780358","2780360","2780362","2836028","2839813","2878648","2896410","2896413","2949253","3029510","3077043","3092263","3092271","3157976","3196379","3219396","323246","323247","323249","3240547","3256060","3315743","3588694","3644060","3680797","3722182","3812018","3812019","3812022","3818498","3906148","3954466","3954469","3978277","4131096","4355386","4494818","449487","451169","451170","451171","451172","451173","451174","451175","451176","451177","451178","4599666","4609616","4878253","4913402","4926075","4975662","5065594","5105078","5176519","517906","5185591","5237901","5237902","5237903","5237905","5237906","5237907","5237908","5237909","5289635","5292207","5316217","5327045","5432077","5537460","5671306","5713959","5713962","5713965","575134","5809827","5809828","5809829","5809830","5809831","5809832","5809833","5809834","5881042","5881046","5930982","5930985","5930986","5930987","5930988","6042757","6042759","6096109","6219641","6223547","6277476","6289799","6459626","6461186","6480272","6580475","6580476","6580477","6580478","6580480","6580481","6580482","6724271","6754763","7151456","7165120","7224846","7242773","7329085","7406721","7677027","7678154","7767165","7803895","7988025","8056821","8164251","8201175","8220134","8260188","8260190","8260191","8260192","8260194","8260195","8260196","8301993","8531640","8643271","8643272","8643275","8643277","8675205","8726232","8785176","8825818","993579"]}

Bones serve as the structural framework, providing support and shape to the body. They also act as levers, allowing for movement when forces are applied. Muscles, on the other hand, are the active components that generate the force necessary for movement. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on the bone to which it is attached, causing the joint to move.\n\nThis process is made possible by the attachment of muscles to bones through tendons, which are strong, fibrous tissues that connect muscle to bone. When a muscle contracts, it shortens, pulling the bone in the direction of the contraction. For example, when you flex your bicep, the biceps muscle contracts and pulls on the forearm bone, causing your arm to bend at the elbow.\n\nTo move in the opposite direction, the muscle must relax, allowing the bone to move back to its original position. This is often assisted by other muscles, known as antagonistic muscles, which work in pairs to create smooth and controlled movement. The nervous system plays a crucial role in coordinating these actions by sending signals through nerves to stimulate muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\nIn summary, muscles and bones function as a dynamic system, with muscles providing the force and bones acting as levers, working together through the nervous system to enable the wide range of movements that allow us to interact with our environment.","dids":["1023019","104789","1157244","1157245","1157247","1157248","1157249","1157251","1225952","1314684","1314689","1333839","1611313","1705204","1827753","1835658","1889340","2049694","2133188","2173072","2265942","2362952","2366115","2366117","2366121","2418363","2510073","2658026","2668726","2686304","2851002","3016126","3139270","3212500","3304067","340875","3500851","3500852","3500854","3500855","3500858","3500860","3865677","3944070","4000566","4098919","4098924","4101948","4101950","4101951","4101952","4101953","41364","430422","4367517","4422338","4422339","4422340","4422342","4422343","4422344","4457201","4718251","478867","4937168","499772","5098399","5126207","516277","5190712","5271686","5271691","5316337","5316338","5337305","554702","5607938","5921140","6007469","6064894","6064897","6290795","6319711","6319712","6319713","6486090","6530476","6638749","6865899","7004631","704609","7107466","7228530","7261857","7705603","7743596","7985117","7985119","8065287","806878","8217013","8225222","8319987","8319989","8319990","8319991","8319992","8319993","8389912","8549945","8685361","8741249","885780","885781","885782","885784","885785","885788"]}

The state imposes a flat income tax rate of 4.95% on taxable income for most residents. This tax applies to income earned within the state, including wages, salaries, and other forms of income such as rental income or investment earnings. Mississippi does not have a personal income tax for residents who live outside the state but work within it, and it also does not tax Social Security benefits. However, individuals who work in Mississippi but reside in another state may still be subject to Mississippi's income tax depending on their specific circumstances. Overall, Mississippi's income tax is relatively simple and uniform compared to other states.","dids":["1395413","1395417","1395418","2256972","2594160","2594161","2888367","3715860","4202278","4580131","4580132","4580133","4762134","4762135","4762141","4762142","4859432","4859433","4859437","4859438","7251632","7251639","8518731","85987"]}

The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia, though sedation or general anesthesia may be used in some cases, especially if the tooth is impacted or difficult to access. \n\nFirst, the dentist or oral surgeon will numb the area around the wisdom tooth with a local anesthetic. Then, they will make an incision in the gum to expose the tooth and any surrounding bone. If the tooth is impacted, it may be split into smaller pieces to make removal easier. Once the tooth is removed, the surgeon will clean the site, stitch the gum back together, and place gauze to control bleeding. \n\nAfter the procedure, patients typically rest for a short time before going home. Recovery can take a few days to a week, with some swelling and discomfort, but most people return to their normal activities within a few days. It's important to follow post-operative care instructions to ensure proper healing and reduce the risk of complications.","dids":["1311741","1348968","1805967","2421112","2898169","2995130","3012167","3638309","3777927","3777930","3777933","3777936","4174308","4174310","4174313","4595794","4595795","6084336","6084339","6990374","8384952","8694161","8694163","91493","955811","955813"]}

On average, the total cost for a small residential wind turbine system ranges from $15,000 to $50,000. This includes the turbine itself, tower, installation, and any necessary electrical upgrades.\n\nIf you choose to install the system yourself, you can save on labor costs, which typically account for about 30-50% of the total price. However, installation requires technical knowledge, proper equipment, and adherence to local regulations and safety standards. You may also need to obtain permits and ensure your property is suitable for a wind turbine, considering factors like wind speed, space, and zoning laws.\n\nFor a small residential system, the turbine itself can range from $5,000 to $20,000, while the tower can add another $5,000 to $15,000. Additional costs may include wiring, inverters, batteries (if off-grid), and maintenance. It\u2019s also important to factor in ongoing maintenance and potential repairs, which can add to the long-term cost.\n\nIn summary, while installing your own wind turbine can be a worthwhile investment for renewable energy, it requires careful planning, budgeting, and consideration of both upfront and long-term expenses. Always consult with professionals to ensure the system is safe, efficient, and compliant with local regulations.","dids":["1097861","1488083","1598185","1637261","1748533","1748536","1748537","233944","233946","233948","233951","233952","3240112","3256084","3297855","3297856","3297857","3297858","3297860","3297862","3857965","4108178","4392140","4392141","4392144","4392147","4620919","4695292","482130","5190215","5393803","5393804","5393805","5393806","5427108","5427113","5557976","5750880","6310757","6310762","6559225","6625463","6625466","6625469","6693239","702096","702098","702099","702103","7074783","7074784","7074787","7394956","803899","8327008","8327010","8327012","8541458","8541461","8590481"]}

When it comes to their egg-laying habits, they are known for their high fertility and frequent laying cycles. On average, a healthy adult button quail can lay eggs every other day, especially during the breeding season, which typically spans from spring through early fall, depending on the climate and environmental conditions.\n\nIn optimal conditions\u2014such as a well-maintained enclosure, proper nutrition, and a consistent day length\u2014female button quails can lay up to 30 eggs per month. However, it's important to note that over-breeding can lead to health issues for the hens, so it's recommended to allow them a rest period between laying cycles. A typical egg-laying cycle for a button quail lasts about 6 to 8 weeks, after which the hen should be given time to recover before being reintroduced to the breeding setup.\n\nEggs are usually laid in a nest, and they are small\u2014approximately 1 to 1.5 inches in length. The incubation period is around 12 to 14 days, and the chicks are precocial, meaning they are able to move around and feed themselves shortly after hatching. Regular monitoring of the quail's health and environment is essential to ensure consistent and healthy egg production.","dids":["1167181","1167184","1443730","1594766","1650687","1831357","2927361","3127493","3127494","3336841","3731313","3883458","4023720","4023722","4056943","4431498","4431502","4614346","4952095","5241320","5241321","5241322","5241323","5241326","5241327","5241328","5241329","5750021","5975274","6007041","6007045","6170826","647131","6514779","6514781","6534081","6616556","6616559","6765227","7073995","7073996","7362661","8021425","8091681","8434869","8434871","8434872","8434873","8434874","8749229","931415","931417","967688"]}

Understanding suffixes helps in expanding vocabulary and improving reading comprehension, as they often provide clues about a word's meaning and usage.","dids":["1012240","1093722","1093726","1093729","1208563","1253139","2168033","2173448","2203875","2203877","3133186","3999219","4506037","4619216","4619218","465790","5423359","5512907","604111","6179316","7186643","749113","7629390","7666614","7765219","7807146","8109962","8630609","8630611","8630612","8630614","8630617","8630618","921155","921157"]}

While both caffeine and narcotics can affect the central nervous system, they do so in fundamentally different ways. Narcotics, such as opioids, are primarily used for their pain-relieving properties and can produce euphoria, sedation, and, in some cases, physical dependence. They often carry a high potential for abuse and are subject to strict regulation.\n\nCaffeine, on the other hand, is a central nervous system stimulant. It works by blocking the action of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep and suppresses arousal. This leads to increased alertness, reduced fatigue, and enhanced cognitive performance. Unlike narcotics, caffeine does not have significant analgesic (pain-relieving) properties, nor does it typically lead to physical dependence or addiction in the same way. However, excessive consumption can lead to dependence and withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and irritability.\n\nIn summary, while caffeine can have stimulating effects on the body and mind, it is not a narcotic and does not fall under the same legal or medical classifications as narcotics.","dids":["1057276","1352544","1352545","1352547","1352549","1352550","1352551","1352552","1518540","1518541","1518543","154239","1724502","1724503","1724504","1724505","1724506","1724507","1724508","2748170","3056677","3150060","3210137","3210138","3236291","3236292","3700382","3790608","3790610","3790613","3912286","3912288","3912290","3912291","4228172","4449599","4607784","4607791","4642223","4642231","4788555","4788556","4919156","4985018","4985020","5252815","5252816","5252819","5515801","5515803","5515804","558748","558751","558752","558756","5745569","5888917","5922366","5922369","5922370","6085620","6250234","6289819","6289820","6289824","6289825","6743548","6743551","6743554","6796409","6796411","6796414","6796415","6796416","6803022","6913938","6913940","6913941","6913942","6945009","7002128","7002129","7002130","7002133","7023318","7140635","7196947","7222499","7222504","7334718","7339772","7474480","7474481","7474482","7474483","7474484","7474485","7474486","7474487","7622492","7634482","7634486","8068413","8068418","8116652","8116653","8116654","8175453","8175458","8204764","8204766","8204767","8475254","8504559","8504560","8608603","8611267","978353"]}

cholesterol through diet is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions. Certain foods have been shown to help lower LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels while supporting overall heart health. Some of the best foods to include in a cholesterol-lowering diet include:\n\n1. **Oats and Other Whole Grains** \u2013 Foods like oats, barley, and whole wheat are rich in soluble fiber, which helps reduce the absorption of cholesterol into the bloodstream. They also help regulate blood sugar levels and support a healthy digestive system.\n\n2. **Nuts** \u2013 Almonds, walnuts, and pistachios are packed with heart-healthy fats, plant sterols, and fiber. They can help lower LDL cholesterol and increase HDL (\"good\") cholesterol.\n\n3. **Fatty Fish** \u2013 Salmon, mackerel, sardines, and trout are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce triglycerides, lower blood pressure, and decrease the risk of heart disease.\n\n4. **Legumes** \u2013 Beans, lentils, and peas are excellent sources of fiber and plant-based protein. They help reduce LDL cholesterol and provide essential nutrients like folate and iron.\n\n5. **Avocados** \u2013 Rich in monounsaturated fats, avocados can help lower LDL cholesterol while increasing HDL cholesterol. They are also a good source of potassium and fiber.\n\n6. **Fruits** \u2013 Berries, apples, and citrus fruits are high in antioxidants, fiber, and flavonoids, which support heart health and help reduce cholesterol levels.\n\n7. **Olive Oil** \u2013 A key component of the Mediterranean diet, olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants. It can help reduce LDL cholesterol and improve blood lipid profiles.\n\n8. **Dark Chocolate** \u2013 In moderation, dark chocolate contains flavonoids that can improve blood vessel function and reduce LDL cholesterol.\n\nIn addition to incorporating these foods, it's important to limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, refined sugars, and processed foods.

It belongs to a class of drugs known as beta blockers, which work by slowing the heart rate and reducing the force of the heart's contractions. This helps to lower blood pressure and decrease the workload on the heart, making it more efficient. Carvedilol is also used in the management of chronic heart failure, where it helps improve symptoms and prolong life. Additionally, it may be prescribed for patients who have had a heart attack to reduce the risk of future cardiac events. As with any medication, carvedilol should be taken under the guidance of a healthcare provider, as it can have side effects and may interact with other drugs.","dids":["119352","119354","119355","119358","119359","1379833","1546126","1546127","1546128","1546129","1546131","1546134","1675561","1675562","1675564","1675566","2038708","2080305","2080306","2080307","2080311","2080312","2142129","2267048","2267049","2267050","2267051","2267052","2267054","2267055","2345777","2672427","2884627","3156907","331028","3325050","3363613","3466605","3466606","3466607","3466610","424310","4502517","5623829","5623832","5623834","5623835","5623837","5623838","5808103","6171513","6271840","6286919","6286920","6286922","6286923","6286924","6286925","6286928","6578660","6654304","6654310","7450717","7450718","7450719","7450725","7465955","7465956","7465960","7473713","7473716","7473719","7491697","7491698","7491699","7491700","7491701","7491702","7491703","7491704","7491705","7491706","7706119","7706120","7706121","7706122","7706123","7744345","7744346","7744347","7744348","7744349","7744350","7744351","8144445","8144447","8144448","8144451","8326076","8326077","8326078","8326080","8395838","8395839","8395840","8395844","8395845","8658401","914661","914662","914663","914665","914666","914667","914668","914669"]}

low TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) level typically indicates that the thyroid gland is producing an excessive amount of thyroid hormone, a condition known as hyperthyroidism. TSH is released by the pituitary gland in response to low levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. When thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary gland reduces TSH production to slow down thyroid activity. \n\nCommon causes of low TSH include Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that stimulates the thyroid to overproduce hormones; toxic multinodular goiter, where multiple nodules in the thyroid produce excess hormone; and thyroiditis, an inflammation of the thyroid that can temporarily release stored hormones into the bloodstream. \n\nSymptoms of low TSH may include weight loss, increased heart rate, anxiety, heat intolerance, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. In some cases, a low TSH may be asymptomatic, especially if the condition is mild or if the body has adapted to the excess thyroid hormone.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment, as untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to complications such as heart problems, bone loss, and infertility. Blood tests to measure TSH, free T4, and sometimes thyroid antibodies can help determine the underlying cause and guide treatment options.","dids":["1004231","1034851","1034854","1126450","1126452","1186733","1204542","1226405","1227303","1227863","1238025","1304074","1307361","1398131","1415945","1448096","1489142","1518725","1587282","1754997","1854588","1854589","1957247","1957252","2060863","2060864","2060868","208375","208378","2096762","2096763","2096764","2121023","2146065","215342","2177945","218503","2195505","2216803","2267182","2290445","2701130","2778108","2808569","2808576","2989520","3022406","3026712","3066747","3066749","310779","3193027","3229236","3229239","3229241","3263516","3282142","3367629","3367630","343072","3551380","3554994","3602544","3678130","3682401","3703701","3803120","3839636","3839637","3851748","390165","3905959","3926698","3927576","3927852","3973990","3992432","3992434","4027990","4088606","418508","418511","4261742","430748","4314284","4314290","4359113","4359116","4359297","4359298","4450952","4568361","4682367","4778464","480549","4835720","4888715","4955687","4998514","5073872","5161853","5224081","5505906","5537119","5821902","5827713","5910009","5924242","598202","598204","6146400","6218616","6258985","6354341","6354345","6354346","6354348","6466454","6497381","6497385","6539166","6621552","6647308","6647309","6647310","6702284","6702288","6702955","6730883","6730884","6730887","6775352","6776100","6835512","6850717","6854281","6857991","6914960","6929876","6985038","6997565","7000432","7037260","706771","7109035","7109037","7112191","7112192","7275188","7315196","7322516","7334494","7420930","7456402","7470129","7540167","7682642","7880194","7917064","7929765","8097987","8233395","8348102","8412229","8450445","845159","8462353","8471417","8628509","8659174","877566","894100","914682","914685","941128","944945"]}

The word \"alm\" is derived from the Arabic root \"al-ma,\" which means \"to give\" or \"to donate.\" In Islamic teachings, giving alms is considered a fundamental aspect of worship and a means of purifying one's wealth and intentions. \n\nAlms, or *zakat* in Arabic, are typically given as a portion of one's wealth to those in need, such as the poor, the needy, and those who are in debt. This practice is not only a form of social responsibility but also a way to cultivate generosity, empathy, and a sense of community. \n\nIn many Islamic cultures, giving alms is seen as an act of worship that brings spiritual and moral benefits. It is often performed regularly, and the act itself is believed to bring blessings and a sense of fulfillment. While the concept of alms is rooted in Islam, similar practices of charitable giving can be found in various religious and cultural traditions around the world.","dids":["1398748","1511452","1511454","1511455","1511457","1511458","1511459","1511460","1868789","1868791","1881872","2013193","3006587","3025089","316790","3345261","3345265","3345267","3345269","3863633","41455","537584","5415079","6182115","7257297","7257298","7257300","7257301","7257302","8008343","8008345","8008348","8008352","8064649","836634"]}

The term \"chronometer\" comes from the Greek words *chronos* (time) and *metron* (measure), meaning \"time measure.\" It is designed to maintain consistent timekeeping despite environmental changes such as temperature fluctuations, humidity, and mechanical stress.\n\nThe invention of the chronometer is often credited to **John Harrison**, an English clockmaker, who developed the first practical marine chronometer in the 18th century. His work was driven by the need to solve the problem of determining a ship's longitude at sea, which was a major challenge for sailors during the age of exploration. Before the invention of the chronometer, sailors relied on methods like dead reckoning, which were often inaccurate and led to many maritime disasters.\n\nHarrison's first successful chronometer, known as **H4**, was completed in 1761. It was a small, precision timepiece with a balance spring and a temperature-compensating mechanism. Despite initial skepticism from the Royal Navy and the scientific community, Harrison eventually won the Longitude Prize in 1773, confirming the effectiveness of his invention. The chronometer revolutionized navigation and became an essential tool for maritime exploration, trade, and military operations. Today, chronometers are still used in various fields, including aviation, space exploration, and scientific research, where precise time measurement is vital.","dids":["1625670","1625674","2666436","2666442","2666444","2776032","3476824","4118696","4118698","437274","4605022","5059707","5452882","6734967","7916064","8276217","8276218","8276220","8276221","8276223","8276225","8276226","8413914","8577877","8577878","8577882"]}

The most common materials used in hip implants include cobalt-chromium alloys, titanium alloys, and sometimes stainless steel. Cobalt-chromium alloys are frequently used for the ball component of the implant due to their high strength, wear resistance, and biocompatibility. Titanium alloys are often used for the femoral stem, which is inserted into the thigh bone, because they are lightweight, strong, and have good bone integration properties. In some cases, other metals like stainless steel may be used for parts of the implant, but they are less common due to their lower strength and higher risk of corrosion compared to cobalt-chromium and titanium. The choice of metal depends on factors such as patient age, activity level, and the specific design of the implant. Overall, the metals used in hip replacements are carefully selected to ensure long-term durability, minimal wear, and compatibility with the human body.","dids":["1030813","1050327","119535","1314509","1314514","1335170","1420115","1495853","1495856","1495857","1550610","1550611","1550612","1550613","1719922","1830189","2298374","2515032","2515036","2581230","2640804","2781468","3052868","3248714","3328098","35107","35108","35109","35111","35112","35113","35114","3716286","379134","3879161","3879167","3982277","4080568","4402455","4534156","4800292","4888926","4888929","4888932","5037396","5063955","5063956","5063961","5196143","5196144","5196148","5758399","5940393","5940394","6269998","6269999","6270000","6306991","6680909","6704838","6762711","6770400","6833786","7040017","7040022","7050366","726822","7346771","7380092","7380094","7380100","7714177","788181","788184","7906970","7952694","8049109","8165590","8187046","825224","8494608","8511146","8659718"]}

Created by game show host and producer Merv Griffin, the show was inspired by the classic board game of the same name. It quickly became a cultural phenomenon, known for its fast-paced, humorous format and the intense rivalry between contestants.

It was heavily influenced by the rhythm and blues (R&B) music that had been popular in the African American communities, particularly in the Mississippi Delta. The genre took on a new energy and appeal with the rise of electric guitars, driving rhythms, and youthful exuberance.\n\nThe term \"rock 'n' roll\" was first used by disc jockey Alan Freed in the mid-1940s, though it wasn't until the 1950s that it became a distinct and widely recognized style. Artists like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley played pivotal roles in shaping the sound and culture of early rock 'n' roll. Their energetic performances and charismatic personalities helped bring the genre to mainstream audiences, marking the beginning of a cultural phenomenon that would define a generation.","dids":["1335718","1383750","160231","1976277","2404877","2613393","2667345","2667347","2667350","2667353","2699754","2729630","2814756","2826200","3378656","3547813","3547822","3558983","3705517","3705518","3706456","3814285","3899964","3899965","4086990","4377478","4377484","4487321","4489259","4489262","4489266","4664997","4665000","4696636","4696640","4696642","4696643","4800886","4800890","4820847","4820850","506000","506003","506006","5118370","5118371","5118373","5118376","5118378","5270014","5270015","5288444","5300647","5300648","5300651","5300654","5831703","5831707","5831708","5831711","61062","61068","61070","61071","6295874","6298951","6656482","6693958","6782541","6782543","6938106","7201455","7259157","7280583","7280584","7282174","7282176","7290071","7290072","755181","7848061","7855425","7960362","8219044","8219049","8219050","8219052","8219055","8219244","8219249","8254214","8269673","8269679","8269680","8772071","8772073","8772074","8772075","8805011","964766","964772"]}

The execution took place in the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg, Siberia, following the October Revolution of 1917, which led to the Bolsheviks seizing power and the subsequent execution of the Romanov family.\n\nNicholas II and his family were held in various prisons and eventually moved to Yekaterinburg under the pretense of being granted a temporary stay in a house. However, the Bolsheviks feared that the royal family might be rescued by anti-Bolshevik forces or that the Tsar could be used as a political tool. To prevent this, the Bolsheviks decided to execute the entire family.\n\nThe execution was carried out by a group of Bolshevik soldiers and local workers under the supervision of a Red Army officer, Yevgeny Bazarov. The Tsar, his wife Alexandra, their five children, and their loyal servants were shot in the basement of the Ipatiev House. After the execution, the bodies were dismembered, and the remains were hidden in various locations. Many of the remains were later recovered and reburied in a mass grave in 1998, with a formal burial ceremony held in 2000 in the Cathedral of the Resurrection in St. Petersburg. Nicholas II's death marked the end of the Romanov dynasty and the end of imperial rule in Russia.","dids":["1149115","127925","127930","1356426","1637693","1637694","1637695","1727793","1845636","2443317","2443319","2443321","2664986","2664988","2664989","2664990","2664992","2664993","2664995","3374866","3378240","3878603","3878608","4355523","4355525","4541688","4994428","5058738","5262289","650641","650642","7022079","7137848","7137849","7137851","7137852","7137853","8696952","8696953","8696954","8696956","8696957","8696960","8696961"]}

When a shotgun is fired, the pellets spread out in a pattern, and the size and spread of this pattern depend on factors like the type of shot, the distance to the target, and the choke tube used. By patterning their shotgun, hunters determine how their shot spreads at various distances, allowing them to select the appropriate choke and shot size for the game they are pursuing. This practice ensures that the hunter can make clean, quick shots, increasing the likelihood of a successful and humane harvest. Patterning also helps hunters understand the effective range of their firearm, which is crucial for ethical hunting and avoiding wounded animals that may escape.","dids":["129459","129462","129468","2839843","2977160","402493","6062648","6824284","6824285","6824287","6824288","7556561","816339","8680897","8680901","8680902","8680903","8680904","8680905","8680906","8734273"]}

Rose, who played for the Cincinnati Reds and other teams from the 1960s through the 1980s, was a legendary player known for his batting eye and 4,256 hits. However, in 1989, he was indicted for betting on baseball games, specifically on his own team, the Cincinnati Reds. The charges stemmed from a federal investigation that revealed Rose had bet on games during his career, which violated baseball's then-strict anti-gambling rules.\n\nAlthough Rose was never convicted of a crime, the league's ethics committee found him guilty of violating the rules and banned him from the Hall of Fame in 1989. The decision was controversial, as many believed that the punishment was excessive given that Rose was not proven to have committed a criminal act. Despite his pleas for reinstatement and the eventual expiration of his lifetime ban in 2022, Rose has remained excluded from the Hall of Fame, making him the only player in history to be denied enshrinement due to ethics violations. His case remains a significant and debated chapter in baseball history.","dids":["3016474","3016479","3016481","3575934","3719926","3928913","3928914","3928915","3928916","3928917","3928918","3928919","4717401","4794978","6508491","6508493","6508494","6508498","7778577","8378382","8378383","8378385","8378386","8378388","8378389","8378390","8378391","8698267","8698269","8698270","8698271","8698272","8698273","8698274","8698275","8698276"]}

The concept was first introduced by the physicist John Wheeler in the 1950s as a way to explore the nature of gravity and the possibility of quantum gravity.\n\nGeons are thought to be extremely small and massive, with properties that could potentially explain certain phenomena in the early universe, such as the formation of black holes or the behavior of spacetime at very high energies.

It is based on the Pareto principle, also known as the 80\/20 rule, which suggests that a small percentage of causes (typically around 20%) are responsible for the majority of the problems (about 80%). \n\nThe Pareto chart is a type of **bar chart** that displays the frequency or impact of different categories in descending order, with the most significant factor on the left and the least on the right. In addition to the bars, a **line graph** is often superimposed on the chart to show the cumulative percentage of the total, which helps visualize the contribution of each factor to the overall problem.\n\nPareto charts are widely used in fields such as business, manufacturing, and project management to prioritize actions and allocate resources effectively. By identifying the \"vital few\" causes that contribute to the majority of the issues, organizations can focus their efforts on solving the most impactful problems first.","dids":["1039252","1207096","1589841","2306620","2375311","2375312","2375313","2375316","2375317","2496608","2591534","2789920","2789921","2884219","2884220","2884221","2884222","2884223","2884224","2884225","2884226","2884227","2884228","2985391","3095113","3290646","3290649","3290651","3363286","3417281","348054","348055","348057","4085365","4085367","4085368","4219185","4585827","4741934","4779469","4885502","490077","5390489","6189807","6221486","6221487","6221490","6670167","6756977","7295948","7329311","7674419","7920795","7920797","7920803","799359","799360","8190133","8190134","8190136","8190137","8190138","8190139","8190140","8496904","947605"]}

For everyday white clothes, such as t-shirts or jeans, a mixture of white vinegar and water can be an effective natural whitener. Fill a laundry basket or sink with cold water, add a cup of white vinegar, and soak the clothes for several hours or overnight. This helps to brighten colors and remove mildew or odors without harsh chemicals.\n\nFor more stubborn stains or when you want a deeper clean, use a commercial laundry detergent that contains bleach or oxygen-based bleach. Always check the care label on the garment to ensure it's safe for bleach. For delicate fabrics like silk or lace, opt for a gentle, color-safe bleach or a non-chlorine bleach to avoid damaging the fabric.\n\nAnother effective method is to use baking soda. Create a paste by mixing baking soda with a small amount of water and apply it directly to stains. Let it sit for a few minutes before washing as usual. Baking soda also helps to neutralize odors and brighten whites.\n\nTo maintain the whiteness of your clothes, avoid using hot water for delicate whites, as it can cause fading. Wash whites separately from dark-colored clothes to prevent color transfer. Additionally, air-drying clothes in the sun can help to naturally brighten them and reduce the need for frequent washing.\n\nIn summary, the best way to get clothes white involves a combination of proper cleaning agents, correct water temperature, and appropriate care to preserve fabric integrity and brightness.","dids":["1127407","1179694","1294050","1421349","1421350","1421351","1421352","1421353","1421354","1421355","1421358","1457501","1643324","1643325","1649633","1649635","1649636","1649639","1649640","1649642","1714260","2141333","2141334","2141336","2564930","2589356","2589358","2589362","2682940","2745683","2903084","2920134","3023371","3102788","3102792","3102796","3381620","3381621","3665394","3671161","370201","3719558","3909386","3909388","3909393","3909933","3941207","3941209","3941210","4572520","4747642","4911228","496571","5002826","5066712","5330509","5330512","5330515","5431537","5802626","5830553","5878614","5878615","5878616","5878620","5878621","6048405","6048411","6058576","6169875","6254865","6254867","6254868","6254871","6254873","6254874","6450417","6522183","6623205","6635998","6636001","6731792","6756165","6916357","6942555","7238041","7341607","7545003","7545011","7654965","7654968","7996105","815597","8175406","8175408","8175409","8175410","8175411","8175412","8175414","8250174","8258085","8289552","8289554","8289556","8289557","8289558","8289559","8289561","8410352","8410357","8444073","8591633","865539","93018"]}

waves are a type of electromagnetic wave, which means they do not require a physical medium to travel through. Unlike sound waves, which need air, water, or another material to propagate, radio waves can travel through a vacuum. This is because they are composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that can move through space without the need for particles to carry the energy. As a result, radio waves can travel vast distances through the atmosphere, the Earth's surface, and even through outer space, making them essential for communication technologies such as radio broadcasting, television, and mobile phone signals.","dids":["1011113","1062372","1143386","1143389","1176874","1190624","1207305","1235929","1255271","1255274","1537820","1542649","1608567","1639996","1671344","1671348","1671349","1671350","1719371","1719374","1719375","1736725","1823563","1911564","1969321","2031419","2031422","2245437","2273663","2510185","2536029","2553869","2646538","2790438","3035396","3037788","3039462","3039465","3039466","3160613","3161726","3325866","3490347","353765","353771","3645097","3676846","3677520","3731699","3982977","4044432","4099609","4122615","4122618","4133177","4236627","4294915","432533","432534","4332695","4370752","4370753","4370756","458599","459375","4709476","4709477","4714159","4714162","4772152","4933634","4933636","5030441","5030442","5030443","5030447","5030448","5113116","5121347","5145050","5329506","5340015","5340019","5395870","5415865","54382","5443410","5443411","5484999","5501511","5628870","5628871","568573","5688650","5740304","5826551","5835104","5942603","5942607","5947139","5947140","5971128","5971129","5971131","5971133","5971134","5973837","6105463","6238285","6238289","6238290","6716569","6752975","6752977","6752984","679386","679387","679388","6872195","6939055","7082492","7233616","7241551","7241557","7241559","7245419","7299963","7342843","7416527","74490","7554894","7566099","7566102","7671117","7671118","7671120","771002","771745","7782492","785762","7940355","7979662","7979664","8008033","8165490","8165491","8165492","8165495","8165497","8363276","8363279","8363280","8363281","8411157","8447187","8552235","8564593","8669895","8683978","8746672"]}

These systems are designed to deceive the missile's guidance system and increase the chances of the aircraft evading a threat.\n\nChaff is a cloud of small, thin metallic strips or particles, typically made of aluminum or other conductive materials, that are released from the aircraft. When deployed, chaff creates a large amount of radar-reflective material in the air, which can mimic the radar signature of the aircraft. This confuses the missile's radar guidance system, making it difficult for the missile to distinguish between the actual aircraft and the chaff. Chaff is most effective against radar-guided missiles.\n\nFlare, on the other hand, is a type of visual countermeasure. It involves the deployment of small, bright flare-like devices that emit intense heat and light. These flares are designed to attract the attention of heat-seeking missiles, which rely on detecting the heat signature of the target. By emitting a much stronger heat source, the flare can trick the missile into locking onto the flare instead of the aircraft. Flares are most effective against infrared (heat) guided missiles.\n\nBoth chaff and flare are used in combination to provide a layered defense against different types of missile threats, enhancing the survivability of the aircraft in combat situations.","dids":["3689359","3689362","4781712","5769768","8111878","8111879","8111882","8111884","8111885","8111886","8111887"]}

It occurs when there is a break or absence of sedimentary rock layers, often due to erosion or uplift, followed by the deposition of younger sedimentary rocks on top of older, usually igneous or metamorphic rocks. This discontinuity signifies a period of time during which no sediment was deposited, and in some cases, existing rock layers were removed by weathering and erosion. Nonconformities are important features in geology because they help scientists understand the history of Earth's surface and the processes that have shaped it over millions of years. One common example of a nonconformity is the Great Unconformity found in the Grand Canyon, where nearly 1.25 billion years of Earth history is missing between the oldest metamorphic rocks and the overlying sedimentary layers.","dids":["1537447","283259","283261","283262","283267","2960678","3588234","521341","521345","5752652","684558","684564","765645","765646","8100542","8100545"]}

If you experience or witness discrimination in the workplace, there are several steps you can take to address the situation and protect your rights.\n\nFirst, it is important to understand that discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information is illegal under the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws. In Oklahoma, additional protections may also apply under state law.\n\nIf you are being discriminated against, you should document all incidents, including dates, times, locations, and details of what occurred. Keep records of any communications, emails, or messages that may be relevant. It is also advisable to report the issue to your employer\u2019s human resources department or a supervisor, if appropriate and safe to do so.\n\nIf internal reporting does not resolve the issue, you may file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC is a federal agency that enforces anti-discrimination laws. In Oklahoma, you can also contact the Oklahoma Human Rights Commission (OHRC), which provides additional resources and legal protections under state law.\n\nAdditionally, seeking legal assistance from an employment lawyer who specializes in discrimination cases can be beneficial. Many organizations in Oklahoma City offer free or low-cost legal aid services to individuals who have been discriminated against in the workplace.\n\nIt is also important to support your rights by staying informed about your legal protections and being proactive in advocating for a fair and inclusive work environment. By taking these steps, you can help ensure that discrimination is addressed and that justice is served.","dids":["1032847","1122644","1194373","1287148","1292498","1467169","1692766","1727594","1763439","1773261","1791221","1854967","1854970","195106","195111","1976011","2014565","2213820","2403262","2592540","286759","2984491","3393177","3405327","3405776","3541848","3541854","3641804","3763467","4249415","4259960","4361549","4440318","4440324","4459866","4513265","4513266","4828747","4872676","4881885","4933438","4969903","5187358","5265072","5277905","5277906","5357560","5387479","5411951","5517896","5540041","5606068","5642762","5754666","5956716","6000313","6022928","6303946","6352617","6381284","6381285","6434034","6606557","6606558","6751341","6751346","6870700","6870701","7070396","710825","7191734","7245650","7323417","7363360","7527098","7538286","7538287","770279","770280","7843479","8053108","8053109","8053110","8053112","8053113","8053117","8213349","824320","8261242","8275387","8339023","8404173","8523256","8531112","858644","907547","907550"]}

is a compound that plays a crucial role in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are used for energy production. The synthesis of carnitine is a multi-step process that involves several amino acids and other molecules. The key amino acid involved in the production of carnitine is **lysine**.\n\nLysine serves as a precursor in the biosynthesis of carnitine. Specifically, lysine is converted into a compound called **gamma-butyrobetaine** through a series of enzymatic reactions. Gamma-butyrobetaine is then converted into **carnitine** by the enzyme **gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase**, which requires vitamin C (ascorbic acid) as a cofactor.\n\nThis process primarily occurs in the liver and kidneys. The availability of lysine and vitamin C is therefore essential for the efficient synthesis of carnitine. A deficiency in these nutrients can lead to reduced carnitine levels, which may impact energy metabolism and overall health.","dids":["1176273","1231532","1238934","1253474","1253475","1368156","1429180","1489273","1703863","1901639","1968737","2019367","2019371","2291735","2358778","2597575","2642213","2859900","2859901","2859903","2859904","2859907","2869517","2873459","2873460","2912048","3192617","3368028","3407780","3407781","3537520","3559288","3559293","3945670","3945676","3945678","4039158","4039159","4055798","4102083","4160569","4161416","4161419","4259801","4364715","4461306","4461309","4461310","4461311","4461313","4550503","4550504","4550505","458261","466849","468959","4784605","4824677","4824679","4824681","4919643","4972396","5285491","5468401","5468404","5468407","5604729","5796709","585508","585509","585618","5877495","5877496","5877499","5877500","6043811","6049010","6063622","6063626","6179207","6179209","6179210","6179213","6179214","6232839","6477425","668427","6727500","6727502","6727505","6727509","6739572","6760591","6844136","6849069","6851716","6851717","6851718","6851720","7102820","7145529","7378733","75236","7525356","7544609","7727590","7863109","7900654","7970636","8039582","8039583","8039588","8039590","8061227","8061231","8061233","8061234","8239643","8326513","8385762","8718034","884946","884952"]}

It is commonly used in programming and scripting languages, particularly in Unix-based operating systems. The word \"shebang\" is a portmanteau of \"shell\" and \"bang,\" with \"bang\" being a slang term for the exclamation mark (!). \n\nIn practice, the shebang line is typically written as `#!\/bin\/bash` for a Bash script, `#!\/usr\/bin\/env python` for a Python script, or similar for other programming languages. This line instructs the operating system to use the specified interpreter to run the script. Without a shebang line, the script may not execute correctly, or it may depend on the default shell or interpreter settings of the system.

According to recent data from sources like Glassdoor, PayScale, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for data analysts in the United States ranges from approximately $70,000 to $110,000. Entry-level data analysts may start at around $60,000 to $75,000 per year, while those with several years of experience or advanced degrees, such as a master's or Ph.D., can expect to earn significantly more, often exceeding $100,000. In high-cost-of-living areas like New York, San Francisco, or London, salaries tend to be higher, sometimes reaching $120,000 or more. Additionally, data analysts working in industries such as technology, finance, healthcare, and e-commerce often command higher salaries due to the demand for data-driven decision-making. It's also worth noting that remote data analysts may have different salary structures depending on their location and the company's global compensation policies. Overall, data analysis remains a highly competitive and well-compensated field, offering strong earning potential for those with the right skills and experience.","dids":["1012084","1245510","1245511","1258883","1258885","1258886","1290702","2354524","2354530","23962","2451602","2495466","2495468","2495469","2495472","2495473","2536147","2655517","331542","331543","331545","3406612","3797904","3959","40091","4068056","4110870","4851669","4851673","4851677","4893092","4893093","5041349","5053523","5053525","5130842","5274017","5377364","5382160","5382162","5446722","5446723","5446724","5446727","545521","5754557","5754559","5883142","5883143","5910809","5989417","5989420","5989421","5989422","6000895","6036017","6036022","6117740","6117745","6176605","6176606","6176610","6189364","6189365","6189366","6189367","6189369","6208534","6208541","6248327","6281311","6514640","661416","6653839","6653842","6653846","6832788","6832789","6832790","6832791","6832793","6832794","6832795","6832797","718132","7452212","7508490","7508491","7508493","7508496","7543158","7543160","7543163","7543164","7657695","7793971","7941105","8078183","8307656","8307661","8307662","8310437","8318621","8318622","8318623","8318624","8318625","8318626","8413224","8505750"]}

When the skin or tissue is damaged, the body initiates a complex sequence of events to repair the injured area. Initially, blood vessels near the wound may rupture, leading to bleeding and the formation of a clot. This clot, composed of platelets and fibrin, serves as a temporary barrier to prevent further blood loss and infection.\n\nAs the healing process progresses, inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages migrate to the wound site to clear debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue. These cells release growth factors and cytokines that stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts, which are specialized cells responsible for producing collagen and other extracellular matrix components.\n\nFibroblasts begin to lay down collagen fibers and other structural proteins, forming a network that provides strength and support to the healing tissue. At the same time, new blood vessels (angiogenesis) form to supply oxygen and nutrients to the growing tissue. This combination of new blood vessels, collagen, and fibroblasts creates the characteristic granulation tissue, which appears as a pink, granular, and moist layer at the base of the wound.\n\nGranulation tissue is a critical phase in wound healing, as it provides a foundation for the eventual formation of new skin and epithelial cells. While it is not yet fully functional tissue, it sets the stage for the final stages of healing, including re-epithelialization and remodeling of the healed tissue.","dids":["1200778","1200780","1297452","1318188","1318196","1659306","1659308","1659309","1694484","1694485","1817052","1817053","1817054","1817055","1817058","2067537","2067542","2067544","2067545","2130045","2130048","2448462","2623943","2727068","2829602","3321778","3691482","3691484","3691487","3841449","4057637","4057642","4274862","4274863","4274864","4274865","4274867","4506270","4668677","4868943","4931640","4931641","4931642","4931643","4931644","4931645","4931647","5277542","5277543","5801087","6252755","6252757","6252760","6252762","6600375","670206","733202","733203","733204","733205","733206","733207","733208","733209","733210","733211","8220876","8220877","8220878","8220879","8379130","8379131","8379132","8379133","8379135","8587177","8741946"]}

After the annual inundation of the Nile, a layer of silt would settle across the floodplains, giving the soil a deep, dark color and making it incredibly fertile. This black soil was essential for agriculture, allowing the Egyptians to cultivate crops such as wheat, barley, and flax, which were vital to their society.\n\nThe fertility of the land was not only crucial for sustaining the population but also held deep spiritual and cultural significance. The ancient Egyptians viewed the land as a gift from the gods, and the black soil symbolized life, renewal, and abundance. The contrast between the black land (*Kemet*) and the surrounding desert (*Desert*, or *Deshret*) emphasized the sacredness of their environment and the importance of the Nile in shaping their civilization. Thus, the name *Kemet* reflected both the physical characteristics of the land and its central role in Egyptian life and belief.","dids":["188463","2145927","2165371","2458252","2458254","2458255","2481400","2481403","2668190","2736920","2736924","2839204","3049173","3049177","3049179","3049180","3224898","3293337","3348372","3492138","3504820","3504821","3586539","3603071","3646987","3857818","3863653","4024823","4088981","4170447","4405500","4405509","4548553","4589723","4589724","4589728","4589730","4601613","5002975","5414508","5471438","5642688","596001","596005","6185710","6185711","6185712","6185714","6185715","6185716","6185717","6185719","6211004","6274391","638900","6684779","6684788","6842810","7023364","7023369","7578949","7621135","7631079","7631082","7631083","7631084","8049609","8064869","8336574","8336575","8336578","937258"]}
