This definition encompasses the cultural, social, and ecological contexts within which individuals interact with their surroundings. The environment is not just a physical space, but also a dynamic system of relationships, norms, values, and meanings that influence human well-being and agency.\n\nAnthropologists recognize that environmental perceptions are shaped by local knowledge, traditions, and worldviews, which intersect with global forces such as climate change, globalization, and technological advancements. The environment is not just an object or space, but a lived experience that is intertwined with the social, economic, and political structures of human societies.\n\nBy examining the relationships between humans and their environments, anthropologists seek to understand how people negotiate, resist, and adapt to changing conditions that impact their daily lives, cultural practices, and very existence. This nuanced understanding of environment highlights the intricate interconnectedness of physical and non-physical factors, revealing the agency and resilience of human societies in shaping their surroundings.","dids":["1729","3175481","3175484","8412681","8412682","8412683","8412684"]}

The causes of LVH are diverse and complex, encompassing both genetic and acquired factors. Hypertension is the most common cause, often resulting from excessive sodium retention, sympathetic nervous system activation, or renal artery stenosis. Other etiologies include valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, cardiac amyloidosis, and chronic kidney disease.\n\nGenetic predisposition plays a role in some cases of LVH, particularly with conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, certain medications like corticosteroids and beta-blockers can cause LVH as an adverse effect.\n\nIn patients with hypertension, the excessive volume load on the left ventricle leads to fibroblast proliferation and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, resulting in increased wall thickness. Other mechanisms, including abnormal calcium handling within cardiac myocytes and increased expression of growth factors, contribute to the development of LVH. In some cases, structural abnormalities such as an apical displacement or anteriorward movement of the ventricular apex may also be present.\n\nIn summary, left ventricular hypertrophy is a multifactorial condition that can arise from various causes, including hypertension, valvular disease, and genetic predisposition.","dids":["1700168","2307974","2530227","2556151","2986227","4689523","4689525","4786305","5103077","5103083","5469038","5497677","5753301","6484575","6484576","6521366","6685092","742425","7526679","753721","7586365","8151926","8165401","8332546","8332547","8332555","8534130","8534134","8565420","8683183","8683185"]}

An RN is a licensed healthcare professional who has completed a nursing program and passed a certification exam, such as the NCLEX-RN. They work under the supervision of a registered nurse or physician to provide direct patient care.\n\nOn the other hand, a BSN is a specific undergraduate degree that prepares students for a career in nursing. It typically takes four years to complete and includes coursework in nursing theory, clinical practice, and community health. A BSN-prepared nurse can become an RN through licensure exams or \"track\" options, such as the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (ABSN) program.\n\nWhile all BSN-holders are eligible for RN licensure, not all RNs have a BSN degree. Some RNs may hold associate's degrees or diplomas in nursing and still be licensed to practice. In summary, an RN is a specific role that requires licensure, while a BSN refers to the educational background and degree held by those who pursue this career path.","dids":["1299824","1311202","1384441","1384446","1384447","1384448","1559002","1816663","1828165","1950974","1950977","1950980","1969519","1985491","231453","2455774","2643562","2713526","3310962","3918785","3918787","4264121","4447598","4902096","4976411","5010072","5077705","6434592","6536612","7407803","985492","985494"]}

Juvenile goldfish undergo rapid growth during their first year of life, increasing in size by up to 50% and developing adult features such as scales, fins, and coloration.

pneumophila is a bacterium that can cause Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia. The bacteria infect the lungs by invading the alveoli and causing inflammation, leading to symptoms such as high fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The pathogenesis involves the binding of L. pneumophila to host cells, particularly macrophages, which facilitates its internalization and replication within the cell.\n\nIn Legionnaires' disease, the bacteria produce a toxin that damages the lung tissue and disrupts gas exchange, leading to hypoxia. Additionally, the infection triggers an immune response characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can cause further damage to the lungs.\n\nHowever, not all Legionella pneumophila infections result in pneumonia. Some strains are non-pathogenic or only cause mild symptoms, such as Pontiac fever, a self-limiting illness characterized by flu-like symptoms without lung involvement.\n\nIt's essential to differentiate Legionnaires' disease from other types of pneumonia caused by other pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, which can present with similar clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease typically requires laboratory confirmation through urinary antigen tests or PCR, and treatment usually involves antibiotics such as azithromycin or levofloxacin.","dids":["1090088","1090089","1183706","119130","1274194","1301465","1301466","1301467","1301468","1301469","1301471","1301472","1301473","1301474","13499","1381477","1677027","1735358","1735360","1860843","1924796","1924800","1974321","1982106","2036279","2036283","2069988","2069992","2069995","2210772","2210774","2210775","2210780","2265769","2265772","2611845","2659074","2735305","2774860","2790904","2806307","290826","3004214","3033359","3174840","3198680","3198681","3198682","3198683","3198686","3198687","3198689","3344828","3344834","3344837","3399712","3399713","3399715","3399716","3399717","3399718","3463552","3463555","3463556","3681095","3681097","3681099","3681100","3830857","3908773","3908774","3908775","3908776","3908777","3908778","3908779","3908781","4119829","4191391","4191395","4191396","4215276","4245218","4324487","4324491","4324492","4324493","4493882","4498419","4498423","4600607","4600608","4600609","4600610","4656291","4656297","4741403","4741406","4792582","4792583","5004346","5024306","5024307","5024311","5114458","527409","5293614","5657932","5771045","5935474","5935476","5935477","6012597","6012598","6012600","6061717","6061718","6061719","6061721","6061722","6061723","6061724","6061726","6213322","6213323","6213324","6213325","6213326","6219117","6219118","6249512","6264729","6264731","6264732","6264733","6264734","6264735","6282560","6282561","6282562","6282564","6282567","6329932","6426630","6426631","6426632","6426633","6426634","6426635","6426636","6426637","6426638","6584042","661750","6643451","6786380","6996835","7049039","731200","7337513","7337518","7337519","7492748","7492752","7492753","7492754","7492755","7595682","7595684","8048968","8141128","8185129","8185131","8185134","8185135","8185137","8252757","8252761","8252763","8252764","8319214","8319215","8319216","8319218","851276","856274","8639627","8639630","8639633","8723467","8731617","8731618","8731621","8731622","8731623","8731624","8731625","8743646","8766387","8766391"]}

biology, exons are specific segments of a gene that encode protein-coding regions. They are defined as the coding sequences within genes that are actually expressed during the process of transcription and translation into proteins. Exons are flanked by non-coding introns, which are removed from the pre-mRNA transcript before it undergoes splicing to form a mature mRNA molecule. The combination and order of exons determine the final amino acid sequence of a protein, making them crucial components in the regulation of gene expression and protein function.","dids":["1239964","1247358","1289489","1289490","1289493","1289495","1289496","1289497","1561158","1566057","1605672","1605768","1730858","1750227","1773958","1773959","1908513","192535","1960310","2046681","206299","2095235","2234245","2234247","2352713","2352716","2403808","2403811","2533256","2574033","2644128","2644131","2644132","2644601","26660","2874543","3009378","3093214","3093215","3093217","3093218","3119899","3128361","3128362","3156614","3185607","3185611","327908","327909","327913","3389578","3389579","3389580","3389581","3389584","3389585","349581","349585","3561703","3578563","371475","3854428","3888461","3922973","3928768","3953758","3953760","3987911","4034821","4089637","4134894","4134895","4134896","4134897","4134899","4134901","4134902","4285004","448707","4493913","4493914","4493915","4493916","4493917","4493918","4493920","4493921","4493922","4727412","4727416","4727417","4727418","4727419","4803847","4803848","4803850","4977773","5026678","5026680","5098266","5260515","5260519","5391354","5460936","5460939","5460941","5486284","5534703","5534707","5534710","5534711","5760906","5798333","5798338","5817927","5867683","5899214","6109460","6109461","6114693","6185861","6220736","6247404","6247405","6291380","6533300","6626236","6788947","6879259","7128532","7398706","7448291","7449743","7449744","7449747","7449748","7449750","7449751","7449752","749539","749540","749542","749547","7677968","7677975","7678696","7718047","7718054","7734209","7811888","7920165","7952869","8006512","8121375","8192307","8260787","8381280","8485658","8567665","8570255","8570256","8570257","8570258","8570260","8570261","8570263","8575895","8577215","8767239","8794304","8794306","8794307","8794308","914900","914901"]}

This misconception about sharks being cold-blooded can be attributed to their ability to maintain a constant body temperature through unique physiological mechanisms. The spined pygmy shark (Squaliolus laticaudus) and the bluntnose sixgill shark (Hexanchus griseus) are examples of warm-blooded shark species.\n\nThese sharks have specialized blood vessels and organs that enable them to regulate their body temperature independently of external factors. Their metabolisms remain relatively constant, allowing them to maintain a stable internal temperature range, even when ambient water temperatures change. This adaptation enables these sharks to be more active in colder waters and conserve energy by reducing metabolic rates in warmer conditions.\n\nIn addition, some warm-blooded shark species have larger liver-to-body-mass ratios compared to their cold-blooded counterparts. This increased energy storage capacity may contribute to their ability to maintain a stable internal temperature. Overall, the unique physiological adaptations of these shark species allow them to regulate their body temperature and exhibit endothermic traits.","dids":["1029962","1392585","2763917","3717766","4218707","7510472","7639366","8273754","8273760","8273761","8273762"]}

life cycle of fleas can vary depending on the species, environmental factors, and availability of prey. Generally, flea development can be broken down into three stages: egg, larval, and adult.\n\nFlea eggs are typically laid after a blood meal and can survive for several days to weeks without hatching. The female flea lays an average of 20-50 eggs per day, which hatch into larvae within 3-5 days. Larvae go through four stages of development before pupating, usually taking around 7-14 days.\n\nThe adult flea emerges from the pupa after about 10-21 days and begins feeding on blood immediately. Fleas can live for several weeks to months in this stage, depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and availability of prey.\n\nIn ideal conditions, a flea's entire life cycle can take anywhere from 2-6 weeks, while in less favorable environments, the process can be prolonged. Factors like temperature fluctuations, food scarcity, or exposure to pesticides can significantly impact a flea's lifespan and reproductive success.","dids":["1444286","1610706","1610707","1610710","1610711","1702969","1804644","2089031","2223171","2420367","2474340","2474342","2474346","2498169","2616296","2689662","331929","331931","331932","331934","3338821","3338822","3338825","3338826","3338827","3338828","3372501","3389744","3396076","3577338","3577341","3577344","3577345","3577347","3601329","3601332","3601333","3601337","3835935","3841908","3841910","4016008","4016011","4016017","4043723","4126497","4259227","4367667","447992","4539746","4641917","4647186","4687213","4710717","4825863","4834543","4834547","4834548","5151339","5269173","528372","528375","528376","528380","528381","5324946","5324948","5328095","552765","5583424","5611210","5611211","5611212","5611213","5611214","5611215","5611216","5611217","5611218","5611219","5635515","5635517","5635518","5635519","5635521","5635522","5672391","5688727","5688730","5780490","5819142","58386","58387","5849267","5849268","5849270","5849271","5849272","5849274","5849711","5950718","5950719","5950721","5950722","5950726","6105566","6105568","6105569","6105571","6105572","6198294","6198295","6333839","6334964","6413944","6413950","6413951","6555321","6555322","6641238","6641241","6773914","6773920","6791757","6791760","684616","684618","684621","684622","7323462","7323463","7323466","7323467","7323468","7323470","7323471","7326932","7326933","7326934","7326936","8012101","8012103","8332127","8608903","8608908","8760488","8801661","935825","96851","96855","96857","96858"]}

They encompass a broad range of characteristics, including socioeconomic status, education level, employment status, housing quality, food security, access to healthcare, social connections, and environmental conditions. These determinants can affect an individual's health through various pathways, such as limiting access to healthy food options, creating stressors that impact mental health, or influencing the likelihood of engaging in physical activity.\n\nSDH are interrelated and can vary widely across populations, with some individuals experiencing a cluster of factors that significantly impact their health, while others may experience a more isolated effect. Understanding SDH is crucial for developing effective interventions and policies aimed at reducing health disparities and promoting health equity. By addressing these determinants, communities and healthcare systems can create environments that support health and well-being, rather than simply treating the symptoms of poor health.\n\nKey SDH include:\n\n* Socioeconomic status ( income, education level)\n* Housing quality (affordability, safety, maintenance)\n* Employment status (job security, wages)\n* Food security (access to healthy food options)\n* Access to healthcare services (quality, affordability, location)\n* Social connections (social support networks, community engagement)\n* Environmental conditions (air and water quality, noise levels)\n\nBy recognizing the complex interplay between these factors, we can work towards creating a healthier, more equitable society where everyone has access to opportunities for optimal health and well-being.","dids":["1509940","1509942","3146238","3365636","5339620","6776717","7104825","7199673","7609928","7674859","8441642","87400","87404"]}

Vegetables such as carrots, green beans, broccoli, and cauliflower can also be cooked sous vide with great success. Fruits like pears and apples can be used for desserts or savory dishes, while cheeses like mozzarella and feta can be perfectly heated to melt and infuse flavors. Breads, pastries, and cakes can be cooked evenly and precisely using sous vide techniques, allowing for precise temperature control. Even delicate items like grapes, berries, and herbs can be cooked sous vide with minimal loss of nutrients or flavor.\n\nFurthermore, sous vide cooking is particularly well-suited for cooking complex dishes like braises, stews, and sauces, as it allows for precise control over temperature and time. It's also ideal for cooking a wide range of grains and legumes, such as quinoa, brown rice, lentils, and chickpeas. With its versatility and precision, sous vide cooking has become a popular method in many professional kitchens and home cooks alike.","dids":["1396708","1605506","1815965","1972028","210379","210384","2588143","275724","275726","275728","275732","2923493","2923494","2923496","2923497","2923498","2923501","3385968","3385971","3538160","3538161","3538163","3538167","3538168","3573478","4044822","4279298","4566818","4656722","4834226","4998398","5117497","5774013","5774014","5931262","5931263","5931264","5931265","5931266","5931267","5931268","5931269","5931270","5931271","6181638","6521993","6761347","6923052","7313730","7313733","7816726","7832420","7861747","7861748","7861749","7861750","7861753","7861755","7861756","7885529","8002846","8002850","8002851","8002853","8002854","8002855","8029527","8029530","8029533","8103065","8103066","8103067","82106","82107","82108","82110","82113","8402971","8402972"]}

United States' entry into World War I was a complex and multifaceted process. Initially, the US maintained a policy of neutrality, avoiding involvement in the conflict that began in August 1914. However, several key events and factors contributed to the country's eventual decision to enter the war: Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, the sinking of the passenger ship Lusitania in May 1915, and the collapse of the Russian monarchy in March 1917. As a result, President Woodrow Wilson issued War Emergency Act in April 1917, which led to the US officially declaring war on Germany on April 6, 1917.","dids":["1048074","1074552","1086043","1098172","1124053","1124058","1191942","1191945","12258","12260","12261","12264","12266","1248663","1423677","1523261","1523266","1580961","1585089","16693","1697238","1866482","1866485","1866486","1922586","1923499","1923506","2075189","2091261","2220585","2230089","2230090","2230095","2243178","2391455","2391456","2399257","2402110","2470328","2479413","2496767","2551914","2569813","2569816","2578724","2653693","2728074","2768117","2768120","2768123","2784782","2784784","2951510","2975474","309313","309315","3095450","3132972","3132980","3134988","3192369","3192413","3192421","3259884","3259887","3259889","3259890","3259891","3259892","330159","330165","3327045","3327049","3376182","3376183","3394536","3394537","3516677","3610445","3654233","3654235","3672921","3676185","3802485","3802487","3802488","3871549","3973418","3973423","4066863","4100037","4158206","4310511","4310512","4337526","4337527","4337528","4337529","4337532","4487115","4487118","4559130","45592","4594382","4681094","4712113","4712119","4718159","4718161","4802035","4834969","4834974","5006969","5138680","5166434","5204904","5287968","5360356","5412858","5424172","5442711","5442713","5442718","5766337","5766345","5956099","5956102","5956106","6127389","621539","6232574","6331478","6331481","6347199","6347200","6347205","6347206","6347207","6465910","6465912","6599404","6666444","684828","6987647","7122842","7146775","7146777","7146780","7146781","7247262","7571423","7571424","7571428","759813","7742956","7778354","7791760","7791761","7837936","7837938","7862343","7882525","7952964","7952965","7952966","7952967","7952969","7952971","8170638","8170640","8239876","8239877","8384975","8384979","8669866","8697948","8722081","8821734","8821735","8821736","8821738","8821739","973371"]}

It is characterized by a strong, instinctual feeling that can be both positive and negative. Visceral experiences can be triggered by various stimuli, such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or textures, and are often linked to the body's autonomic nervous system.\n\nIn this sense, visceral reactions can range from excitement and euphoria to fear, anxiety, or disgust. The term \"visceral\" is derived from the Latin word \"viscera,\" meaning internal organs, highlighting the bodily nature of these responses. By describing an experience as visceral, one acknowledges that it arises from a deep, fundamental connection with the self and the world around them.\n\nIn everyday life, people may describe certain situations or events as visceral, conveying that they evoke a strong emotional response that is difficult to rationalize or suppress. For instance, witnessing a beautiful sunset or experiencing a sense of awe at nature's grandeur can be described as a visceral experience. Similarly, feeling fear or anxiety in response to a threatening situation can also be characterized as visceral. By recognizing the role of visceral experiences in shaping our emotions and behaviors, we can better understand the complex dynamics of human perception and interaction.","dids":["1334328","1334330","1334331","1334334","1334335","1334336","2002045","2464375","2672601","2672608","272753","272761","2866630","2960561","2960563","2960566","3470705","4173709","4787149","4787153","4787157","5204536","5204538","5774818","5780391","7500585","7500586","7500587","7685380","7685382","7685385","7685388","7797167","8204457","8204462","8204463","8502783","8521673","8596078","8685446","954035"]}

For many Thais, the day begins with a morning alms-giving ceremony, where Buddhist monks are offered food and incense in exchange for blessings. Afterward, families often gather for a simple but nourishing breakfast, typically consisting of rice, fresh fruits, and steamed vegetables.\n\nAs the sun rises, people head to work or school, often accompanied by the sounds of motorbikes and chatter on public transportation. In urban areas, Thais can be found shopping at bustling markets or exploring modern malls, while in rural regions, daily routines revolve around farming, fishing, or small-scale entrepreneurship.\n\nAfternoons are often spent with family, whether it's watching TV together, playing traditional games like chess or cards, or engaging in outdoor activities like hiking or yoga. As the day cools down, Thais might enjoy a warm dinner at home, featuring popular dishes like pad thai, tom yum soup, or green curry.\n\nEvenings are often filled with socializing, whether it's attending a temple ceremony, watching a live music performance, or simply gathering with friends and family in quiet cafes. As the night winds down, many Thais retreat to their homes to practice meditation, read a book, or enjoy a relaxing bath before drifting off to sleep.\n\nOf course, this is just a glimpse into the daily lives of Thai people, and there are countless variations depending on factors like age, occupation, education level, and geographic location. Nonetheless, one thing remains constant: in Thailand, community, respect for tradition, and warmth of spirit form the fabric of everyday life.","dids":["1035060","1035061","1035062","1035063","1035064","1035065","1035066","1035067","1035068","1228458","1253945","1253952","1267515","1267516","1267517","1267518","1267519","1267520","1369482","1702898","1702902","1707313","1707314","1707315","1707316","1707317","1707318","1707319","1998330","1998331","1998332","1998333","1998335","1998338","2155567","2468291","2468292","2468295","2468296","2468297","2468298","2468299","2596432","2694631","2694632","2694635","2694636","2735219","2860744","2860747","2860749","2925770","2936512","2936513","3016394","3041083","3352255","3352256","3408231","345581","345585","355109","355114","355115","355117","355118","3552356","3670747","3670748","3670750","3670754","3670756","4102529","4161482","4416071","4416076","4566122","4566125","4595993","4595995","4977768","5043409","5133283","5133287","5133288","5192037","6102033","6164791","6303182","6303183","6303184","6303186","6303187","6311795","6311799","6311801","6342847","6726340","6726344","7088035","7088036","7088037","7088039","7088041","7373078","7373085","7516467","7708629","7714607","8134789","8134793","8134797","8139249","8139252","8139255","8139256","8139257","8139258","917582"]}

They have dark green, needle-like foliage that ranges from 2-5 cm in length and is typically two-edged at the base with small white or pale yellowish stomata. The bark of mature spruce trees is thick, grayish-brown, and becomes deeply furrowed with age.\n\nThere are over 35 species of spruce, each with unique traits such as cone size, shape, and color. The most common species include Picea abies (Norway spruce), Picea glauca (White spruce), and Picea pungens (Blue spruce).

medical equipment (DME) refers to medical devices or supplies that are designed to be used by patients with specific medical conditions over an extended period. DME can include a wide range of items, such as:\n\n* Wheelchairs and mobility aids\n* Oxygen concentrators and respiratory therapy equipment\n* Prosthetic limbs and orthotics\n* Bariatric beds and lifts\n* Hospital beds and mattresses\n* Shower chairs and grab bars\n* walkers, canes, and crutches\n* Blood glucose monitors and insulin pumps\n* Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines\n\nThe specific items that are classified as DME can vary depending on the region and country. In the United States, for example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sets national guidelines for what constitutes DME. The CMS defines DME as equipment that is designed to provide therapeutic benefit or alleviate pain, discomfort, or other symptoms associated with a medical condition.\n\nIt's worth noting that some items may be considered non-durable medical equipment if they are not designed to be used by patients over an extended period. Additionally, some states and countries have their own classification criteria for DME, which can differ from the federal guidelines in the United States.","dids":["1009500","1009502","1074899","1119234","11843","1204744","1245291","1248112","1302004","1302007","1315993","1315994","1315995","1315996","1315998","1316000","1333807","1396258","1419798","1419801","1426631","1437537","1602333","1625836","1724520","1724523","1724526","1735443","1738242","1738243","1738244","1738246","1738247","1738248","1738250","1852065","1852066","2008569","2008574","2008577","2040811","2136434","2185129","2185131","2188726","2212053","2212056","2212059","2258946","236347","2477692","2490838","255280","255283","2590447","2590450","2590451","2590453","2590454","2590455","2694515","2756880","2926432","306606","3200532","3256326","3256328","3256329","3256332","327923","327926","344350","344351","344354","344355","3477360","3484458","3556105","3641925","3641926","3641927","3734231","3781418","3781419","3814005","3814007","3824972","3835158","3835163","3906952","3906954","3906956","3906959","3925394","393994","4404333","4550069","4700106","4700110","4700111","4700114","4865755","4865758","4890560","5019832","5019839","5165249","534362","5375238","5375243","5375245","5375246","538319","5521371","5521372","5521373","5626706","5628950","5628952","5628953","5628955","5718415","5718417","5718418","576249","5858980","59259","6027616","605467","605472","6094261","6202319","6202321","6239487","6631098","6631099","6820823","6900766","6900767","6900769","6900773","6900774","6912302","6941478","6941481","694735","694737","694740","6988364","7070942","7156443","7355554","7355561","7425393","7425394","7425397","7552823","7562839","7562841","7567806","7588045","7588046","7655520","768360","7696996","7803429","7803435","785027","785028","7851749","7873197","7914603","7991186","8022276","8022280","8024890","8027206","8027210","8088111","8096817","8096824","8115434","8115435","8115439","8115440","8115700","8321012","8336225","8336226","8336229","8336230","8336232","8461285","8480574","8508255","8508259","8508263","858812","8601477","8625086","8653330","8688167","8736056","8754397","8754399","8768742","8772339","8804489","988370","988373","988374","988376","988378"]}

This process is characterized by the formation of a zone of deformation and faulting, resulting from the interaction between the overlying plate and the subducting plate. As the subducting plate sinks into the Earth's mantle, it encounters increasing heat and pressure, leading to melting and the release of volatiles. These processes can result in the formation of volcanic arcs, mountains, and other geological features.\n\nIn contrast to passive margins, where plates are moving apart and creating rifts, active margins are marked by intense tectonic activity, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The interaction between the two plates also leads to the creation of a zone of metamorphism, where rocks are transformed due to high pressure and temperature conditions. Understanding active margins is essential for understanding the complex geological processes that shape our planet's surface.\n\nActive margins can be further divided into two subtypes: oceanic-continental and continental-continental. Oceanic-continental margins occur when an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, resulting in the formation of volcanic arcs and mountain ranges. Continental-continental margins, on the other hand, involve the collision between two continental plates, leading to the creation of fold mountains and other geological features.","dids":["1389420","1440192","1445087","1652329","1687526","1798612","1798614","1798619","1798620","2058940","2504563","2515909","2579691","2790381","2790382","2790384","334611","3349612","3440615","3543106","3607850","3780997","3781003","3859042","4059509","4393946","4393950","4441325","444196","4458509","4458510","4458512","4573811","4698655","4775947","518714","52516","52523","5258462","5286538","5286539","5596485","563625","6057206","6057207","6106022","6122720","6122721","6122722","6122723","6122724","6156360","6177939","6177941","6428299","6428300","6505419","6505420","651006","6534818","6534824","6993942","714808","7504911","7541965","8093931","8093932","8093934","8208315","8294083","8446501","8446502","8446504","8446505","8446506","8459091","8459093","859540","8615590","8714082","8714085","8838111","926743"]}
