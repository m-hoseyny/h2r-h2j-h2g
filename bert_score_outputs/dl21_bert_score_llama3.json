we age, our bodies undergo various changes that can affect our overall health and well-being. One of these changes is the loss of bone mass, also known as osteoporosis. The process of losing bone mass begins at an early age, but it accelerates significantly after menopause in women and andropause in men.\n\nFor women, the decline in bone density starts around puberty, when estrogen levels decrease. However, this gradual decrease is usually not noticeable until a woman reaches her mid-to-late 30s or 40s. The rate of bone loss continues to accelerate after menopause, typically between the ages of 45 and 55. During this period, women are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis.\n\nFor men, the decline in bone density starts earlier, around age 20-30. This is because testosterone levels decrease more significantly with age, leading to a loss of bone mass. The rate of bone loss accelerates after age 40, and by the time men reach their 60s or 70s, they are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis.\n\nIt's essential for both women and men to take proactive steps to maintain strong bones throughout life. This includes a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive drinking.

However, this liability can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the incident.\n\nGenerally, landlords are not directly liable for damages caused by an intruder if they have taken reasonable steps to ensure the safety and security of their tenants. This includes maintaining a secure building, installing proper locks and alarm systems, and providing adequate lighting and surveillance.\n\nHowever, landlords may be held liable in certain situations:\n\n1. **Failure to maintain a safe premises**: If a landlord is found to have been negligent in maintaining a safe environment for their tenants, they may be held liable for any damages or injuries caused by an intruder.\n2. **Knowledge of a hazard**: If a landlord knew about a specific hazard on their property, such as a broken lock or a hidden danger, and failed to take action to address it, they may be held liable for any subsequent harm caused by an intruder.\n3. **Gross negligence or recklessness**: In cases where a landlord's actions (or lack thereof) show gross neglect or reckless disregard for the safety of their tenants, they may be held fully liable for any damages or injuries caused by an intruder.\n\nIt is also worth noting that some jurisdictions have \"duty to protect\" laws, which hold landlords responsible for protecting their tenants from harm. These laws vary widely, and it is essential to consult with a qualified attorney to understand the specific laws in your area.\n\nIn addition to these general principles, there may be other factors that affect a landlord's liability in the event of an intruder incident. For example:\n\n* **Insurance coverage**: If a landlord has adequate insurance coverage for their property and tenants, they may be able to rely on their insurance policy to cover any damages or injuries caused by an intruder.\n* **Premises access**: If a landlord provides unauthorized access to potential intruders, such as through a shared entrance or unsecured area, they may be held liable for any harm caused by those individuals.\n\nUltimately, the specific circumstances of an intruder incident will determine whether a landlord is liable for damages or injuries. It is crucial for landlords and tenants alike to understand their rights and responsibilities in this regard.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_726578676","msmarco_passage_02_500355930","msmarco_passage_02_500357167","msmarco_passage_02_720119353","msmarco_passage_02_720125121","msmarco_passage_03_865272429","msmarco_passage_03_865272976","msmarco_passage_03_865273362","msmarco_passage_03_865273798","msmarco_passage_03_865277218","msmarco_passage_03_865280777","msmarco_passage_03_865281718","msmarco_passage_03_865282196","msmarco_passage_03_866751723","msmarco_passage_03_866752270","msmarco_passage_03_866752656","msmarco_passage_03_866753092","msmarco_passage_03_866756512","msmarco_passage_03_866760071","msmarco_passage_03_866761012","msmarco_passage_03_866761490","msmarco_passage_03_866764466","msmarco_passage_03_866765013","msmarco_passage_03_866765399","msmarco_passage_03_866765835","msmarco_passage_03_866769255","msmarco_passage_03_866772814","msmarco_passage_03_866773755","msmarco_passage_03_866774233","msmarco_passage_07_323526123","msmarco_passage_07_847592319","msmarco_passage_22_691945221","msmarco_passage_24_751830883","msmarco_passage_24_751833141","msmarco_passage_25_550673992","msmarco_passage_25_550687828","msmarco_passage_26_588239530","msmarco_passage_27_399272486","msmarco_passage_30_113598293","msmarco_passage_30_381335149","msmarco_passage_32_831965118","msmarco_passage_33_783271776","msmarco_passage_37_406975398","msmarco_passage_37_406975944","msmarco_passage_37_406976329","msmarco_passage_37_406976764","msmarco_passage_37_406980176","msmarco_passage_37_406983727","msmarco_passage_37_406984666","msmarco_passage_37_406985143","msmarco_passage_42_184648743","msmarco_passage_46_323106354","msmarco_passage_46_323120159","msmarco_passage_50_609312995","msmarco_passage_50_609527245","msmarco_passage_52_117282982","msmarco_passage_52_117286264","msmarco_passage_52_118222846","msmarco_passage_52_19587834","msmarco_passage_52_296788730","msmarco_passage_52_725769481","msmarco_passage_53_254998669","msmarco_passage_54_52190055","msmarco_passage_57_47654720","msmarco_passage_61_418586357","msmarco_passage_61_567605094","msmarco_passage_63_373580032","msmarco_passage_64_515535838","msmarco_passage_64_515539058","msmarco_passage_65_35603332","msmarco_passage_65_41313356","msmarco_passage_67_908198700"]}

According to data from the United States, the median age of first-time marriages for men has been increasing steadily since the 1960s.\n\nAs of 2022, the median age at first marriage for men in the US was around 29.8 years old, according to data from the Pew Research Center. This represents a significant increase from the 1970s, when the average age of men at first marriage was around 25-26 years old.\n\nGlobally, the average age of men at marriage also varies widely depending on factors such as cultural norms, economic conditions, and education levels. In some countries like South Korea and Japan, where there is a strong emphasis on social reputation and family background, men tend to get married earlier than in Western countries.\n\nFor example, according to data from the World Bank, the average age of first marriage for men in South Korea was around 27-28 years old in 2020. In contrast, in many European countries like Germany and France, the average age of first marriage for men is typically above 30 years old.\n\nIt's worth noting that trends in marriage ages are changing rapidly, with more men delaying their marriages due to factors such as financial uncertainty, career aspirations, and personal freedom. As a result, the median age at first marriage for men is likely to continue increasing in the coming years.\n\nIn summary, while there is no single average age of men at marriage that applies universally, data suggests that the median age of first-time marriages for men has been steadily increasing over time, with variations depending on cultural context and regional factors.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_570495994","msmarco_passage_01_117256968","msmarco_passage_01_358089435","msmarco_passage_01_436571677","msmarco_passage_02_648878058","msmarco_passage_03_220189951","msmarco_passage_03_743205901","msmarco_passage_04_287901958","msmarco_passage_05_363414983","msmarco_passage_07_100117135","msmarco_passage_07_104896351","msmarco_passage_07_282042632","msmarco_passage_07_94355630","msmarco_passage_07_99995512","msmarco_passage_08_380359533","msmarco_passage_08_805249043","msmarco_passage_08_805396147","msmarco_passage_10_30422793","msmarco_passage_11_405307723","msmarco_passage_11_59933115","msmarco_passage_11_59934964","msmarco_passage_11_59935812","msmarco_passage_11_87651770","msmarco_passage_13_137193989","msmarco_passage_15_582147759","msmarco_passage_15_619583701","msmarco_passage_16_351379843","msmarco_passage_18_221399667","msmarco_passage_19_71344912","msmarco_passage_19_857745018","msmarco_passage_19_858004434","msmarco_passage_20_346841834","msmarco_passage_23_864601995","msmarco_passage_25_192291144","msmarco_passage_27_711427689","msmarco_passage_28_600331430","msmarco_passage_28_600332146","msmarco_passage_28_600332496","msmarco_passage_29_109179960","msmarco_passage_29_409688111","msmarco_passage_29_655975423","msmarco_passage_30_590351057","msmarco_passage_30_725337281","msmarco_passage_37_500000413","msmarco_passage_39_147134385","msmarco_passage_39_604156597","msmarco_passage_40_237257983","msmarco_passage_40_398498150","msmarco_passage_41_263863504","msmarco_passage_41_263916437","msmarco_passage_41_264060755","msmarco_passage_41_719845192","msmarco_passage_43_101809619","msmarco_passage_43_96209725","msmarco_passage_45_264750792","msmarco_passage_47_727213984","msmarco_passage_50_17951343","msmarco_passage_51_55496481","msmarco_passage_51_59949637","msmarco_passage_57_15345234","msmarco_passage_57_18921993","msmarco_passage_57_18942785","msmarco_passage_58_388835310","msmarco_passage_62_613505678","msmarco_passage_62_797641797","msmarco_passage_63_434339571","msmarco_passage_63_696247141","msmarco_passage_63_696249111","msmarco_passage_66_773193685","msmarco_passage_68_19987965","msmarco_passage_68_4692280"]}

This region is where the esophagus transitions into the throat. In normal anatomy, this area is smooth and flexible, allowing for easy passage of food.\n\nIn individuals with crested syndrome, abnormal muscle contractions and thickening of the muscle tissue in this region can lead to esophageal dysfunction. This dysfunction can manifest as difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), chest pain, and regurgitation of food or liquids.\n\nEsophageal dysmotility, which refers to impaired movement of food through the esophagus, is a common feature of crested syndrome. The abnormal muscle contractions in this region can cause food to become stuck, leading to symptoms such as food impaction, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing.\n\nIn addition to esophageal dysfunction, individuals with crested syndrome may also experience other symptoms such as:\n\n* Chest pain or discomfort\n* Regurgitation of food or liquids\n* Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n* Weight loss\n* Coughing or wheezing\n\nThe exact cause of crested syndrome is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to genetic factors, environmental influences, and possibly an autoimmune response. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging studies such as barium swallow, and endoscopic evaluation.\n\nTreatment for crested syndrome usually focuses on managing symptoms and improving esophageal function. This may include medications to relax the muscles in the esophagus, dietary modifications to reduce strain on the esophagus, and lifestyle changes to improve overall health and well-being. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to relieve pressure and improve esophageal function.\n\nOverall, crested syndrome is a rare but serious condition that requires prompt medical attention from an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist or gastroenterologist.

debate between whether light intensity or concentration of carbon dioxide has a higher rate of photosynthesis is a longstanding one in the field of plant physiology. While both factors play crucial roles in regulating photosynthetic rates, the consensus among scientists suggests that light intensity has a more significant impact on photosynthesis.\n\nWhen light intensity increases, it not only provides plants with the energy they need to power photosynthesis but also directly stimulates the production of ATP and NADPH through the light-dependent reactions. These high-energy molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) to fix CO2 into organic compounds such as glucose.\n\nIn contrast, the concentration of carbon dioxide is crucial for photosynthesis but does not have a direct impact on the rate of photosynthesis in the same way that light intensity does. While an increase in CO2 concentration can enhance photosynthetic rates by reducing stomatal resistance and allowing more CO2 to enter the leaf, this effect is often indirect and limited.\n\nStudies have shown that at high light intensities, plants may actually experience photoinhibition, a phenomenon where excessive light energy leads to damage to photosynthetic pigments and electron transport chains. This can result in reduced rates of photosynthesis rather than enhanced ones.\n\nOn the other hand, an increase in CO2 concentration has been consistently shown to increase photosynthetic rates across a range of plant species and growth conditions. However, this effect is often limited to moderate increases in CO2 concentrations (up to 1,000 \u03bcmol\/mol), beyond which it becomes less pronounced or even negative.\n\nIn conclusion, while both light intensity and concentration of carbon dioxide are important factors influencing photosynthetic rates, the evidence suggests that light intensity has a more significant impact on regulating photosynthesis. This is because light intensity directly drives the production of high-energy molecules necessary for photosynthesis, whereas CO2 concentration has a more indirect effect, primarily by reducing

However, here's a general overview of the steps that usually occur:\n\n1. **Birth Registration**: After your baby is born, you'll need to register them with the state vital records office. This involves providing personal identification information about yourself and your baby, as well as completing any necessary paperwork.\n\n2. **Initial Enrollment**: The hospital or birthing facility will typically submit an initial enrollment request for Medicaid on your behalf. They may use a standardized form called the Certificate of Live Birth (CLB) to report the birth to the state Medicaid agency.\n\n3. **Medicaid Application**: Within 30 days of the birth, the state Medicaid agency is required to review the CLB and determine eligibility for Medicaid coverage. If your baby is eligible, they will be automatically enrolled in Medicaid.\n\n4. **Redetermination Process**: Every 12-18 months, the state Medicaid agency will re-determine your baby's eligibility for continued coverage. This process involves reviewing their Medicaid status and updating their benefits as needed.\n\n5. **Notification of Eligibility**: If your baby is found eligible for Medicaid, you'll typically receive a notification letter or confirmation from the state Medicaid agency outlining their coverage details, including any applicable premiums, copays, or deductibles.\n\n6. **Parental Consent**: In most states, both parents are required to provide consent for their child's Medicaid enrollment. If only one parent has provided consent, the other parent may be contacted by the state Medicaid agency to obtain their approval as well.\n\nIt's essential to note that eligibility rules and procedures can vary significantly depending on the state and local healthcare system. Additionally, some states have expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which may affect your baby's eligibility for Medicaid. If you have questions or concerns about your baby's Medicaid enrollment, it's best to contact your state Medicaid agency directly for more information.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_519958397","msmarco_passage_00_519958843","msmarco_passage_00_519959336","msmarco_passage_00_519959798","msmarco_passage_00_519960195","msmarco_passage_00_844892323","msmarco_passage_00_845451689","msmarco_passage_01_715187212","msmarco_passage_02_524456355","msmarco_passage_06_134542315","msmarco_passage_10_719899498","msmarco_passage_10_719900430","msmarco_passage_10_719901294","msmarco_passage_11_635624585","msmarco_passage_12_257259671","msmarco_passage_12_257261585","msmarco_passage_14_861468229","msmarco_passage_16_233612290","msmarco_passage_16_233614001","msmarco_passage_17_302520998","msmarco_passage_17_302530152","msmarco_passage_24_101723464","msmarco_passage_24_212247486","msmarco_passage_24_212251364","msmarco_passage_24_557811804","msmarco_passage_24_558733063","msmarco_passage_24_558733512","msmarco_passage_24_558757434","msmarco_passage_24_558757883","msmarco_passage_24_559066049","msmarco_passage_24_559073437","msmarco_passage_25_132167309","msmarco_passage_25_442532762","msmarco_passage_27_446399410","msmarco_passage_27_446579079","msmarco_passage_27_446848924","msmarco_passage_27_446928349","msmarco_passage_27_447419308","msmarco_passage_27_447541315","msmarco_passage_28_849508578","msmarco_passage_30_115010807","msmarco_passage_30_724824820","msmarco_passage_40_752092285","msmarco_passage_41_701759035","msmarco_passage_43_233194869","msmarco_passage_43_356464336","msmarco_passage_44_466774508","msmarco_passage_44_466841210","msmarco_passage_44_855171420","msmarco_passage_47_8825711","msmarco_passage_48_281213320","msmarco_passage_48_543344314","msmarco_passage_48_567480447","msmarco_passage_48_567683653","msmarco_passage_48_567684107","msmarco_passage_48_567684415","msmarco_passage_48_567685848","msmarco_passage_48_567688091","msmarco_passage_48_567688492","msmarco_passage_48_567689849","msmarco_passage_48_645331947","msmarco_passage_48_803544705","msmarco_passage_48_814683122","msmarco_passage_50_254104149","msmarco_passage_51_683986454","msmarco_passage_53_448831389","msmarco_passage_54_644477902","msmarco_passage_55_534768923","msmarco_passage_55_789164596","msmarco_passage_57_187390900","msmarco_passage_59_717022340","msmarco_passage_59_779343147","msmarco_passage_65_219561470","msmarco_passage_65_219573228","msmarco_passage_65_628619479","msmarco_passage_66_78013759","msmarco_passage_66_95392700","msmarco_passage_66_95402626"]}

The legislation imposed stricter regulations on oil spill prevention, response, and cleanup, with the goal of protecting marine ecosystems and human health.\n\nUnder the OPA 90, oil companies are required to implement safety measures to prevent oil spills, such as double hulls and other containment measures, to ensure that their vessels can withstand rough seas and other adverse weather conditions. The law also established a system for reporting oil spills, requiring oil companies to notify authorities immediately in the event of a spill.\n\nOil companies are responsible for paying for the cleanup costs associated with an oil spill, which can be substantial. Under the OPA 90, the responsible party is required to pay for all reasonable expenses incurred by government agencies and third parties involved in responding to and cleaning up the spill. This includes costs such as equipment, personnel, and transportation.\n\nThe OPA 90 also imposes strict penalties on oil companies that fail to comply with regulations or violate safety standards. These penalties can include fines of up to $1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled, as well as other civil and criminal penalties.\n\nFurthermore, the OPA 90 has led to increased public scrutiny and demand for greater accountability from oil companies. The law requires oil companies to report their environmental performance on an annual basis, providing a snapshot of their progress in preventing and responding to oil spills. This transparency has helped to build trust with regulators and the public, who expect oil companies to take responsibility for their operations.\n\nOverall, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 has significantly increased the regulatory burden on oil companies, requiring them to invest more in safety measures, spill prevention, and cleanup costs. While some argue that this increased regulation is excessive and burdensome, others see it as a necessary step to ensure the protection of marine ecosystems and human health.\n\nIn recent years, some oil companies have taken steps to capitalize on the benefits of OPA 90, such as by offering \"oil spill response training\" to employees or partnering with governments to develop new technologies for spill prevention. However, the law's emphasis on accountability and transparency remains a contentious issue among stakeholders.\n\nUltimately, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 has played a critical role in shaping the oil industry's approach to safety, spill prevention, and cleanup. While challenges remain, the law has helped to establish a framework for responsible oil operations that prioritizes environmental protection and public safety.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_18414553","msmarco_passage_01_18419824","msmarco_passage_01_18421906","msmarco_passage_03_860887012","msmarco_passage_04_683570514","msmarco_passage_04_683570710","msmarco_passage_04_683571154","msmarco_passage_07_367180550","msmarco_passage_07_367182198","msmarco_passage_07_367182777","msmarco_passage_07_367183200","msmarco_passage_07_367183561","msmarco_passage_07_737393239","msmarco_passage_10_602776522","msmarco_passage_12_426429806","msmarco_passage_15_789050318","msmarco_passage_17_527700910","msmarco_passage_17_527703255","msmarco_passage_17_527707278","msmarco_passage_17_527707724","msmarco_passage_17_527708622","msmarco_passage_17_527709372","msmarco_passage_17_527709807","msmarco_passage_17_527710252","msmarco_passage_17_527710667","msmarco_passage_17_527711518","msmarco_passage_17_527712431","msmarco_passage_17_527712961","msmarco_passage_18_784313247","msmarco_passage_26_562634447","msmarco_passage_30_631109766","msmarco_passage_36_301500596","msmarco_passage_36_301500994","msmarco_passage_36_301507809","msmarco_passage_36_301508151","msmarco_passage_36_301508981","msmarco_passage_36_301509436","msmarco_passage_36_301509882","msmarco_passage_36_301510338","msmarco_passage_36_301510770","msmarco_passage_37_12435424","msmarco_passage_42_254196571","msmarco_passage_42_254206406","msmarco_passage_45_423986487","msmarco_passage_45_441302401","msmarco_passage_45_441303308","msmarco_passage_45_442414342","msmarco_passage_45_442422969","msmarco_passage_45_59850061","msmarco_passage_45_59857432","msmarco_passage_51_100507824","msmarco_passage_51_100509472","msmarco_passage_51_100510051","msmarco_passage_51_100510474","msmarco_passage_51_100510835","msmarco_passage_51_88229309","msmarco_passage_52_633940249","msmarco_passage_55_502516645","msmarco_passage_65_555171171","msmarco_passage_65_555171684","msmarco_passage_65_555172153","msmarco_passage_65_555172961"]}

The healing time for a sprained wrist varies depending on the severity of the injury, but generally, it takes several weeks to a few months for the wrist to fully recover.\n\nMild sprains, where only one or two ligaments are stretched or torn, typically heal within 2-4 weeks with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). In these cases, the pain and swelling will gradually subside, and the wrist will regain its strength and flexibility within a few days to a week.\n\nModerate sprains, where more ligaments are affected or the wrist is more severely injured, may take 4-6 weeks to heal. During this time, it's essential to follow a rehabilitation program that includes physical therapy exercises, bracing, and gradual return-to-activity protocols to ensure proper healing and prevent further injury.\n\nSevere sprains, where multiple ligaments are torn or the wrist is severely injured, may require surgical intervention and longer recovery periods of 6-12 weeks or more. In these cases, it's crucial to work closely with an orthopedic specialist or sports medicine physician to develop a personalized rehabilitation plan that addresses specific needs and promotes optimal healing.\n\nIn general, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommends the following recovery times for wrist sprains:\n\n- Mild sprain: 2-4 weeks\n- Moderate sprain: 4-6 weeks\n- Severe sprain: 6-12 weeks or more\n\nIt's essential to note that individual healing times can vary significantly, and proper treatment and rehabilitation are critical in preventing long-term damage and promoting optimal recovery.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_188112775","msmarco_passage_02_511537499","msmarco_passage_04_101017695","msmarco_passage_04_101018170","msmarco_passage_04_101018724","msmarco_passage_04_311968552","msmarco_passage_06_462575340","msmarco_passage_07_761661213","msmarco_passage_08_636369710","msmarco_passage_10_623653554","msmarco_passage_10_625336052","msmarco_passage_10_625345271","msmarco_passage_10_660105712","msmarco_passage_12_564827826","msmarco_passage_28_326468821","msmarco_passage_28_817004525","msmarco_passage_38_315746340","msmarco_passage_38_316025462","msmarco_passage_39_711850438","msmarco_passage_39_711855226","msmarco_passage_39_711858840","msmarco_passage_39_711863628","msmarco_passage_45_188908738","msmarco_passage_48_763440047","msmarco_passage_48_836681421","msmarco_passage_48_836681885","msmarco_passage_48_858987729","msmarco_passage_53_555404211","msmarco_passage_58_107305431","msmarco_passage_61_344475322","msmarco_passage_66_279963003","msmarco_passage_66_685366858","msmarco_passage_66_685673120"]}

However, according to various studies and reports from organizations such as the Marine Mammal Commission and the International Whaling Commission, it's estimated that hundreds of whales are entangled in fishing gear each year in U.S. waters.\n\nOne study published in the Journal of Cetacean Research and Management found that between 2015 and 2018, a total of 433 marine mammals (including whales, dolphins, and porpoises) were removed from fishing gear off the West Coast of North America, with California being one of the primary areas affected.\n\nIn particular, the study reported that:\n\n* 144 humpback whales were caught in fishing nets during this period\n* 75 gray whales were also entangled\n* 64 blue whales were incidentally caught\n\nIt's worth noting that while these numbers are concerning, they represent a small fraction of the total number of whales that migrate through California waters each year. The Pacific Ocean is home to an estimated 10,000-15,000 humpback whales, and many other species of whales migrate through the region as well.\n\nTo combat this issue, organizations such as the Whale Entanglement Response Network (WERN) and the Marine Mammal Center work with fishing industries, regulatory agencies, and conservation groups to develop and implement best practices for reducing bycatch and entanglement in fisheries. Additionally, efforts are being made to strengthen regulations and enforcement around whale protection, including the passage of legislation such as the Whale Protection Act.\n\nOverall, while the exact number of whales caught in fishing nets off California is difficult to quantify, it's clear that entanglements remain a significant threat to these magnificent creatures, and continued conservation efforts are necessary to protect them.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_158178731","msmarco_passage_01_860445714","msmarco_passage_01_860445927","msmarco_passage_01_860446367","msmarco_passage_01_860446792","msmarco_passage_01_860447214","msmarco_passage_01_860447599","msmarco_passage_01_860447907","msmarco_passage_02_631756281","msmarco_passage_03_463626718","msmarco_passage_04_561345592","msmarco_passage_04_561347004","msmarco_passage_04_561347969","msmarco_passage_04_561348785","msmarco_passage_04_561349155","msmarco_passage_04_561349553","msmarco_passage_04_561350056","msmarco_passage_05_421042467","msmarco_passage_05_421043525","msmarco_passage_05_421043874","msmarco_passage_05_421044294","msmarco_passage_05_421044739","msmarco_passage_05_421045138","msmarco_passage_05_421045653","msmarco_passage_05_421046003","msmarco_passage_10_457250983","msmarco_passage_10_457251442","msmarco_passage_10_457252165","msmarco_passage_10_457252879","msmarco_passage_12_18847084","msmarco_passage_12_33236690","msmarco_passage_18_743987700","msmarco_passage_19_92793538","msmarco_passage_23_307538604","msmarco_passage_28_865414530","msmarco_passage_29_752023711","msmarco_passage_30_197848168","msmarco_passage_33_503719675","msmarco_passage_35_461936291","msmarco_passage_35_594922783","msmarco_passage_44_581402674","msmarco_passage_46_376990978","msmarco_passage_46_377099042","msmarco_passage_46_377342828","msmarco_passage_46_377979165","msmarco_passage_46_378859318","msmarco_passage_47_342206698","msmarco_passage_48_244666680","msmarco_passage_48_244898865","msmarco_passage_51_212299641","msmarco_passage_55_215478994","msmarco_passage_57_481826926","msmarco_passage_62_872025429","msmarco_passage_67_1777942","msmarco_passage_68_212793328","msmarco_passage_68_213251933"]}

The specific sentence for money laundering can range from fines to imprisonment, with the length of incarceration varying based on the type and quantity of drugs involved, as well as any other crimes committed in conjunction with the money laundering scheme.\n\nUnder federal law, money laundering is classified into three levels of severity:\n\n*   Level I: A person who commits a money laundering offense involving less than $10,000 can face up to 5 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.\n*   Level II: A person who commits a money laundering offense involving between $10,000 and $500,000 can face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000.\n*   Level III: A person who commits a money laundering offense involving more than $500,000 can face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $5 million.\n\nAdditionally, if the money laundering offense involves narcotics trafficking or other serious crimes, such as conspiracy or racketeering, the sentence can be significantly longer. For instance, if convicted of running a large-scale narcotics trafficking operation that also involved money laundering, an individual may face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $5 million.\n\nInternationally, the penalties for money laundering vary widely depending on the jurisdiction. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, money laundering can carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. However, other countries may impose much shorter sentences or focus more on fines and asset forfeiture.\n\nIn conclusion, the length of time served in jail for money laundering can range from several years to decades, depending on the severity of the offense and the individual's prior record.","dids":["msmarco_passage_02_562680030","msmarco_passage_03_500285269","msmarco_passage_04_149106008","msmarco_passage_04_272056614","msmarco_passage_04_451515431","msmarco_passage_04_815543932","msmarco_passage_04_827695197","msmarco_passage_05_339916252","msmarco_passage_05_339916787","msmarco_passage_05_339917213","msmarco_passage_05_424213181","msmarco_passage_05_424216085","msmarco_passage_05_845757340","msmarco_passage_06_543338157","msmarco_passage_07_827871453","msmarco_passage_13_529244621","msmarco_passage_14_193793985","msmarco_passage_14_239095335","msmarco_passage_14_491489667","msmarco_passage_14_491490487","msmarco_passage_14_491491316","msmarco_passage_14_491492111","msmarco_passage_15_364840381","msmarco_passage_17_660918641","msmarco_passage_17_686995702","msmarco_passage_18_451910654","msmarco_passage_18_663829519","msmarco_passage_18_745657026","msmarco_passage_19_96146849","msmarco_passage_20_258080636","msmarco_passage_20_479410633","msmarco_passage_21_566617296","msmarco_passage_22_444489053","msmarco_passage_24_373748098","msmarco_passage_26_350243017","msmarco_passage_26_350243559","msmarco_passage_26_350243980","msmarco_passage_26_615632791","msmarco_passage_28_48280009","msmarco_passage_28_817645953","msmarco_passage_29_490441262","msmarco_passage_33_532528857","msmarco_passage_36_850727476","msmarco_passage_37_347590763","msmarco_passage_37_347880724","msmarco_passage_40_184457582","msmarco_passage_41_208995053","msmarco_passage_41_212377934","msmarco_passage_41_294857900","msmarco_passage_41_829135740","msmarco_passage_41_853646717","msmarco_passage_42_671053391","msmarco_passage_42_671053926","msmarco_passage_44_178929410","msmarco_passage_44_187996505","msmarco_passage_45_326378810","msmarco_passage_46_122986831","msmarco_passage_46_122989408","msmarco_passage_46_123076542","msmarco_passage_46_124446439","msmarco_passage_46_156653618","msmarco_passage_46_156655676","msmarco_passage_48_253244347","msmarco_passage_51_532132796","msmarco_passage_51_532136011","msmarco_passage_51_533903775","msmarco_passage_52_491191467","msmarco_passage_52_724523436","msmarco_passage_52_724524474","msmarco_passage_52_724524912","msmarco_passage_54_546881079","msmarco_passage_54_775535541","msmarco_passage_55_334868093","msmarco_passage_55_742343694","msmarco_passage_55_742344082","msmarco_passage_56_42363487","msmarco_passage_56_449027248","msmarco_passage_60_597359053","msmarco_passage_60_672035513","msmarco_passage_60_672038313","msmarco_passage_60_672040286","msmarco_passage_60_672040749","msmarco_passage_60_672041151","msmarco_passage_60_672041659","msmarco_passage_60_672095203","msmarco_passage_60_672098003","msmarco_passage_60_672099976","msmarco_passage_60_672100439","msmarco_passage_60_672100841","msmarco_passage_60_672101349","msmarco_passage_61_638700141","msmarco_passage_61_638700575","msmarco_passage_62_90219069","msmarco_passage_63_826006249","msmarco_passage_63_826007040","msmarco_passage_63_826007528","msmarco_passage_65_533805433","msmarco_passage_67_63502466"]}

At the time of his death, he was approximately 28 years old.\n\nMerrick's life with severe physical deformities made it difficult to determine an exact age due to the lack of reliable records. However, based on various accounts from doctors and medical professionals who treated him, it is estimated that he was born in either 1860 or 1862, which would make him around 28 years old at the time of his death.\n\nIt's worth noting that Merrick's life was marked by both suffering and tragedy, but also a remarkable resilience and courage in the face of unimaginable physical challenges. His legacy has endured long after his passing, inspiring numerous books, films, and stage productions about his extraordinary story.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_25911621","msmarco_passage_01_27018824","msmarco_passage_03_236997081","msmarco_passage_04_81160586","msmarco_passage_10_733659281","msmarco_passage_10_733659613","msmarco_passage_26_786292776","msmarco_passage_26_795932174","msmarco_passage_39_490823146","msmarco_passage_39_493999066","msmarco_passage_40_68630057","msmarco_passage_40_68633212","msmarco_passage_47_452999235","msmarco_passage_47_452999695","msmarco_passage_50_348235348","msmarco_passage_63_403372510","msmarco_passage_63_403377222","msmarco_passage_64_35120674","msmarco_passage_64_35121073","msmarco_passage_64_35121645","msmarco_passage_64_35122496","msmarco_passage_64_35122809","msmarco_passage_64_35123135","msmarco_passage_64_35124040","msmarco_passage_64_35124698","msmarco_passage_64_434829785","msmarco_passage_65_57452647","msmarco_passage_65_57454141","msmarco_passage_65_851777415","msmarco_passage_65_851777970"]}

your finger has become jammed, it's essential to take immediate action to relieve the pressure and promote healing. Here are some steps you can follow to help a jammed finger:\n\nFirst, stop any activity that caused the injury and apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every hour or two. This will help reduce swelling and ease pain. You can wrap an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas in a towel to avoid direct contact with your skin.\n\nNext, gently stretch and move your finger to assess its range of motion. If you can't straighten the affected finger or if it feels numb or tingling, seek medical attention immediately. In most cases, jamming is not serious but can cause discomfort for some time.\n\nTo relieve pain and swelling, consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, following the recommended dosage instructions. However, before taking any medication, it's always best to consult with a medical professional.\n\nAvoid using taping or binding your finger too tightly, as this can restrict blood flow and prolong healing time. It's also crucial to maintain good hygiene by washing your hands frequently, especially after touching your jammed finger.\n\nIn most cases, jammed fingers heal quickly without any long-term consequences if proper care is provided. To promote recovery, keep the affected area clean and comfortable, elevate it above heart level when sitting or lying down, and avoid using your jammed finger for activities that exacerbate discomfort.\n\nIf you experience numbness, tingling sensations, or chronic pain in your fingers, consult a medical professional to rule out any underlying conditions. They can provide guidance on the best course of treatment and offer advice on preventing similar injuries in the future.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_686741346","msmarco_passage_02_78414172","msmarco_passage_03_349953368","msmarco_passage_07_447768254","msmarco_passage_07_678711603","msmarco_passage_08_460610026","msmarco_passage_08_460732779","msmarco_passage_08_463565133","msmarco_passage_08_84996000","msmarco_passage_09_484426189","msmarco_passage_09_484426619","msmarco_passage_09_484427074","msmarco_passage_09_484429649","msmarco_passage_09_652665816","msmarco_passage_09_652668025","msmarco_passage_10_191809167","msmarco_passage_10_191809958","msmarco_passage_10_483660290","msmarco_passage_10_483660718","msmarco_passage_10_623649606","msmarco_passage_10_625341323","msmarco_passage_11_3165348","msmarco_passage_11_3168078","msmarco_passage_11_3168914","msmarco_passage_11_3169732","msmarco_passage_11_3170177","msmarco_passage_11_3170636","msmarco_passage_11_3173646","msmarco_passage_11_3174115","msmarco_passage_11_678673849","msmarco_passage_11_678674316","msmarco_passage_11_678674735","msmarco_passage_11_678675186","msmarco_passage_11_678680186","msmarco_passage_11_678681153","msmarco_passage_11_678681620","msmarco_passage_11_678682039","msmarco_passage_11_678682490","msmarco_passage_11_678685113","msmarco_passage_11_678687041","msmarco_passage_11_678687490","msmarco_passage_11_73528860","msmarco_passage_11_73529276","msmarco_passage_11_73530495","msmarco_passage_11_73531462","msmarco_passage_11_73532357","msmarco_passage_11_73532770","msmarco_passage_11_73533192","msmarco_passage_11_73533498","msmarco_passage_11_73534030","msmarco_passage_11_73534622","msmarco_passage_12_190422397","msmarco_passage_24_169621010","msmarco_passage_25_265137572","msmarco_passage_25_596444118","msmarco_passage_25_596444582","msmarco_passage_25_596444800","msmarco_passage_25_596445147","msmarco_passage_25_596446470","msmarco_passage_25_596447400","msmarco_passage_26_848362213","msmarco_passage_28_624418171","msmarco_passage_28_624420387","msmarco_passage_29_246437068","msmarco_passage_31_321388446","msmarco_passage_35_198901955","msmarco_passage_35_755156311","msmarco_passage_39_270598156","msmarco_passage_39_724499436","msmarco_passage_40_268522075","msmarco_passage_40_268531018","msmarco_passage_40_270081287","msmarco_passage_40_271920829","msmarco_passage_40_273117674","msmarco_passage_40_274095530","msmarco_passage_43_286763885","msmarco_passage_43_286764417","msmarco_passage_44_26649905","msmarco_passage_44_26650343","msmarco_passage_44_295914124","msmarco_passage_44_295931028","msmarco_passage_45_179111481","msmarco_passage_48_724793486","msmarco_passage_48_724793970","msmarco_passage_48_724797533","msmarco_passage_48_835463179","msmarco_passage_48_835464001","msmarco_passage_48_835464418","msmarco_passage_48_835464829","msmarco_passage_48_835465238","msmarco_passage_48_835465658","msmarco_passage_48_835466075","msmarco_passage_48_839882852","msmarco_passage_49_7145517","msmarco_passage_50_683470788","msmarco_passage_53_13524903","msmarco_passage_53_13525832","msmarco_passage_53_13526309","msmarco_passage_53_13526730","msmarco_passage_53_13527632","msmarco_passage_53_13528139","msmarco_passage_53_13530065","msmarco_passage_53_428816576","msmarco_passage_53_500354442","msmarco_passage_53_500356532","msmarco_passage_53_500356963","msmarco_passage_53_500361065","msmarco_passage_53_500361899","msmarco_passage_53_500363155","msmarco_passage_53_500363586","msmarco_passage_53_523253921","msmarco_passage_53_523261327","msmarco_passage_53_524181401","msmarco_passage_53_547557084","msmarco_passage_53_589318535","msmarco_passage_55_154918587","msmarco_passage_55_154942432","msmarco_passage_55_272210065","msmarco_passage_55_272622963","msmarco_passage_55_272625444","msmarco_passage_55_272628196","msmarco_passage_55_284125175","msmarco_passage_55_284588164","msmarco_passage_55_284590645","msmarco_passage_55_284593397","msmarco_passage_55_495438225","msmarco_passage_59_36173095","msmarco_passage_59_36176375","msmarco_passage_59_38936471","msmarco_passage_60_322185830","msmarco_passage_61_344447892","msmarco_passage_61_344485493","msmarco_passage_61_344485920","msmarco_passage_61_384193524","msmarco_passage_61_706775831","msmarco_passage_61_706777773","msmarco_passage_61_706778128","msmarco_passage_61_706778420","msmarco_passage_61_706779558","msmarco_passage_61_706780914","msmarco_passage_63_13230428","msmarco_passage_63_13231404","msmarco_passage_64_431437978","msmarco_passage_64_431438402","msmarco_passage_64_431439673","msmarco_passage_64_431440927","msmarco_passage_64_431442249","msmarco_passage_64_431444427","msmarco_passage_64_431444868","msmarco_passage_65_825758557","msmarco_passage_65_825759462","msmarco_passage_65_825760429","msmarco_passage_66_237483120","msmarco_passage_66_237485061","msmarco_passage_66_237486153","msmarco_passage_66_237486899","msmarco_passage_66_617533687","msmarco_passage_66_620471026","msmarco_passage_66_683081038","msmarco_passage_66_82249540","msmarco_passage_66_82250443","msmarco_passage_66_82251408","msmarco

Gardner is an American psychologist, educator, and author known for his theory of multiple intelligences. Born on November 1, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York, Gardner earned his undergraduate degree from Carleton College and his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nGardner's work focuses on the idea that there are multiple types of intelligence beyond the traditional notion of academic intelligence. He proposes that individuals possess a range of cognitive abilities, such as linguistic, spatial, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligences.\n\nGardner's theory of multiple intelligences suggests that these different types of intelligence are not mutually exclusive, but rather interrelated and often overlap. He argues that traditional education systems often neglect or undervalue these diverse forms of intelligence, leading to a narrow focus on academic achievement.\n\nAs an educator, Gardner has advocated for a more holistic approach to learning, one that recognizes and values the unique strengths and abilities of each student. He has worked with schools, universities, and organizations to develop programs and curricula that cater to the diverse needs of learners.\n\nGardner is also known for his work on social-emotional intelligence, which he defines as the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions, as well as those of others. He has written extensively on this topic, including his book \"Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Gardner has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to education and psychology. He is currently a professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education and continues to write, teach, and advocate for innovative approaches to learning and development.\n\nGardner's work has had a significant impact on our understanding of human intelligence and the importance of recognizing diverse forms of cognitive ability. His theory of multiple intelligences has inspired educators, policymakers, and individuals around the world to rethink their approach to education and personal

the United States, the use of pulse oximetry (pulse ox screening) in children has become increasingly widespread and accepted as a standard of care. While it is not strictly \"law\" that all pediatricians perform pulse ox screening on every child, there are several factors that have contributed to its widespread adoption.\n\nHistorically, pulse oximeters were primarily used in hospitals and clinical settings to monitor the oxygen saturation of critically ill patients. However, with advancements in technology and decreasing costs, pulse oximeters became more accessible for home use and non-clinical settings.\n\nIn the early 2000s, several studies demonstrated the benefits of routine pulse ox screening in newborns, including improved detection of congenital heart defects and other underlying conditions. As a result, many pediatric organizations began to recommend regular pulse ox screening as part of newborn well-child visits.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued guidelines for pulse ox screening in infants and children, recommending that healthcare providers use pulse oximeters to assess oxygen saturation in patients who are at risk for respiratory problems, such as those with a history of premature birth or chronic lung disease. The AAP also recommends that pulse oximetry be used in the evaluation of asymptomatic children with a family history of respiratory conditions.\n\nWhile there is no federal law requiring pediatricians to perform pulse ox screening, many states and local governments have enacted regulations or guidelines that mandate or encourage its use. For example, some states require insurance coverage for pulse oximeters as part of their Medicaid programs, making them more accessible for low-income families.\n\nIn addition, several professional organizations, such as the AAP and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), have developed policies and guidelines that promote the use of pulse ox screening in clinical practice. These guidelines often emphasize the importance of routine pulse ox screening as a means of early detection and intervention for respiratory problems.\n\nIn summary, while pulse ox screening is not

The treatment involves injecting a special solution called Supartz into the joint space. So, what is Supartz made of?\n\nSupartz is a proprietary blend of hyaluronic acid and dextrose, which are two naturally occurring substances found in the body. Hyaluronic acid is a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that serves as a key component of the synovial fluid in joints, providing cushioning, lubrication, and shock absorption.\n\nThe Supartz solution contains 1% hyaluronic acid and 0.5% dextrose, which are mixed together to create a sterile, non-potable liquid. The solution is designed to mimic the natural composition of synovial fluid in healthy joints, with the hyaluronic acid serving as a key component of the treatment.\n\nWhen injected into the joint space, Supartz helps to:\n\n* Reduce inflammation and pain\n* Stabilize the joint and reduce joint instability\n* Improve joint mobility and range of motion\n\nThe Supartz solution is typically administered through a small needle under the skin, usually in 2-3 injections spaced over several months. The treatment has been shown to provide significant pain relief and improved joint function for patients with osteoarthritis, making it a popular alternative to traditional joint replacement surgery.","dids":["msmarco_passage_03_800372007","msmarco_passage_03_800375095","msmarco_passage_03_800392027","msmarco_passage_04_588077269","msmarco_passage_04_852056098","msmarco_passage_05_399617967","msmarco_passage_06_119105865","msmarco_passage_06_119109796","msmarco_passage_06_247749678","msmarco_passage_06_247751327","msmarco_passage_08_670354349","msmarco_passage_08_670355264","msmarco_passage_08_670356299","msmarco_passage_08_670357590","msmarco_passage_08_670358143","msmarco_passage_08_670358507","msmarco_passage_08_670358963","msmarco_passage_08_670359408","msmarco_passage_08_89553973","msmarco_passage_08_89555944","msmarco_passage_08_89556785","msmarco_passage_09_277841225","msmarco_passage_09_74041506","msmarco_passage_09_746904864","msmarco_passage_09_746905506","msmarco_passage_09_778985426","msmarco_passage_10_672844862","msmarco_passage_10_672969506","msmarco_passage_11_107969067","msmarco_passage_11_107969493","msmarco_passage_11_107969925","msmarco_passage_12_470032625","msmarco_passage_22_828329287","msmarco_passage_25_811036253","msmarco_passage_30_206330429","msmarco_passage_30_352468640","msmarco_passage_30_352469533","msmarco_passage_30_352484400","msmarco_passage_30_352484758","msmarco_passage_35_819326444","msmarco_passage_35_84442184","msmarco_passage_35_84444675","msmarco_passage_35_84445135","msmarco_passage_38_122726693","msmarco_passage_38_122727138","msmarco_passage_38_122727514","msmarco_passage_38_122728154","msmarco_passage_38_122728628","msmarco_passage_38_122729064","msmarco_passage_38_122729342","msmarco_passage_38_122730601","msmarco_passage_38_122731016","msmarco_passage_38_122731935","msmarco_passage_38_122732738","msmarco_passage_43_14409923","msmarco_passage_44_158358721","msmarco_passage_44_158372450","msmarco_passage_44_158384610","msmarco_passage_44_284050070","msmarco_passage_44_284055814","msmarco_passage_44_313901460","msmarco_passage_44_362405718","msmarco_passage_44_362406488","msmarco_passage_44_362408725","msmarco_passage_44_362409152","msmarco_passage_44_379480659","msmarco_passage_44_379482615","msmarco_passage_44_438841067","msmarco_passage_45_608202489","msmarco_passage_45_608204142","msmarco_passage_45_608311322","msmarco_passage_45_608312975","msmarco_passage_48_845339159","msmarco_passage_49_467140767","msmarco_passage_49_467166812","msmarco_passage_49_467167275","msmarco_passage_49_696929719","msmarco_passage_53_599271707","msmarco_passage_53_599273682","msmarco_passage_53_599274525","msmarco_passage_55_827739172","msmarco_passage_55_827739814","msmarco_passage_56_451558765","msmarco_passage_59_557387458","msmarco_passage_59_557388604","msmarco_passage_59_557390763","msmarco_passage_59_557394349","msmarco_passage_59_557395267","msmarco_passage_59_557396097","msmarco_passage_59_76277175","msmarco_passage_60_172218853","msmarco_passage_65_824769873","msmarco_passage_66_121762269","msmarco_passage_66_121762859","msmarco_passage_66_121763374","msmarco_passage_66_121763816","msmarco_passage_66_121764233","msmarco_passage_66_121766122","msmarco_passage_66_121766949","msmarco_passage_66_121768480","msmarco_passage_66_591286","msmarco_passage_66_591677","msmarco_passage_66_592591","msmarco_passage_66_593005","msmarco_passage_66_594882","msmarco_passage_66_595703","msmarco_passage_66_597205","msmarco_passage_66_598889","msmarco_passage_66_649985","msmarco_passage_66_707972255","msmarco_passage_66_708141642","msmarco_passage_66_80591961","msmarco_passage_66_81479277","msmarco_passage_67_817690606","msmarco_passage_67_817691047","msmarco_passage_67_817691454","msmarco_passage_68_740050126"]}

question of whether Friedrich Nietzsche, the renowned German philosopher, was an atheist is a matter of ongoing debate among scholars and interpreters of his work. On one hand, Nietzsche's critiques of traditional morality and religion, as well as his emphasis on individualism and self-overcoming, have led some to conclude that he was indeed an atheist.\n\nNietzsche's rejection of Christianity and traditional morality can be seen in his works such as \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (1883-1885) and \"Beyond Good and Evil\" (1886), where he questions the value of traditional moral principles and argues that they are based on a false premise. He also critiques the idea of an objective, universal truth, instead positing that values are subjective and relative.\n\nHowever, Nietzsche's views on the nature of reality and the self are more complex than they initially seem to be atheist. On one hand, he rejects the idea of an all-powerful, benevolent God, but on the other hand, he believes in a \"will to power\" (Wille zur Macht), which is a fundamental drive that underlies all living beings and shapes their experiences.\n\nThe concept of the will to power is central to Nietzsche's philosophy, as it posits that life is driven by an innate desire for self-overcoming and creative expression. This idea does not necessarily imply atheism, as it can be seen as a naturalistic and empirically grounded worldview. In fact, Nietzsche often describes the world in terms of its material and natural processes, arguing that our experiences are shaped by forces beyond our conscious control.\n\nFurthermore, Nietzsche's concept of \"eternal recurrence\" (Eternal Return) suggests that all events will recur infinitely, including human existence itself. This idea implies that there may be a kind of cosmic or metaphysical order at work in the universe, which challenges the notion of atheism as we commonly understand it today.\n\nIn conclusion, while Nietzsche's critiques of traditional morality and religion have led some to conclude that he was an atheist, his views on the nature of reality and the self are more nuanced and complex. He does not fit neatly into either the category of theist or atheist; instead, his philosophy is characterized by a naturalistic and empirical worldview that emphasizes individual creativity and self-overcoming.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_656327292","msmarco_passage_01_154604362","msmarco_passage_01_194956100","msmarco_passage_01_234012036","msmarco_passage_01_787955870","msmarco_passage_02_561362243","msmarco_passage_03_748626086","msmarco_passage_03_851893210","msmarco_passage_03_851915559","msmarco_passage_04_129428663","msmarco_passage_04_129429377","msmarco_passage_04_129429834","msmarco_passage_04_452738297","msmarco_passage_05_343347072","msmarco_passage_06_584196373","msmarco_passage_06_611737750","msmarco_passage_07_333202102","msmarco_passage_07_639657097","msmarco_passage_07_788722998","msmarco_passage_08_437709469","msmarco_passage_08_437712145","msmarco_passage_08_437712931","msmarco_passage_08_437713848","msmarco_passage_09_117882396","msmarco_passage_10_691832727","msmarco_passage_11_465542495","msmarco_passage_11_617354223","msmarco_passage_11_617355016","msmarco_passage_11_617358578","msmarco_passage_12_588569088","msmarco_passage_13_345754350","msmarco_passage_13_345755496","msmarco_passage_13_345757682","msmarco_passage_14_194848821","msmarco_passage_17_472065156","msmarco_passage_17_629630260","msmarco_passage_18_35338301","msmarco_passage_18_560604608","msmarco_passage_18_759862675","msmarco_passage_18_777446772","msmarco_passage_19_111706181","msmarco_passage_19_111711518","msmarco_passage_19_111712462","msmarco_passage_19_32398793","msmarco_passage_19_33403510","msmarco_passage_19_402992693","msmarco_passage_20_400758643","msmarco_passage_20_400763580","msmarco_passage_20_400765752","msmarco_passage_21_300921049","msmarco_passage_23_860736582","msmarco_passage_24_490502655","msmarco_passage_24_649417804","msmarco_passage_24_649418327","msmarco_passage_24_649418758","msmarco_passage_25_833258014","msmarco_passage_25_833258318","msmarco_passage_26_732222938","msmarco_passage_28_485912287","msmarco_passage_29_364916433","msmarco_passage_29_429701299","msmarco_passage_29_619645741","msmarco_passage_29_631034257","msmarco_passage_29_780746555","msmarco_passage_29_781845958","msmarco_passage_29_783065918","msmarco_passage_30_27664975","msmarco_passage_30_36592572","msmarco_passage_30_36629846","msmarco_passage_32_525617756","msmarco_passage_34_293290254","msmarco_passage_34_93967147","msmarco_passage_36_40037295","msmarco_passage_36_630182631","msmarco_passage_37_211688063","msmarco_passage_37_363236305","msmarco_passage_37_363242769","msmarco_passage_37_363296970","msmarco_passage_37_363297527","msmarco_passage_37_363298332","msmarco_passage_37_363302645","msmarco_passage_37_822126895","msmarco_passage_38_51045296","msmarco_passage_38_799560881","msmarco_passage_39_497540129","msmarco_passage_40_158087024","msmarco_passage_40_56579098","msmarco_passage_40_61893563","msmarco_passage_40_70107556","msmarco_passage_40_70111232","msmarco_passage_41_504594752","msmarco_passage_45_199662621","msmarco_passage_47_843974765","msmarco_passage_47_843976241","msmarco_passage_47_843978047","msmarco_passage_47_858554771","msmarco_passage_48_150816555","msmarco_passage_51_425263822","msmarco_passage_51_425264307","msmarco_passage_51_425265232","msmarco_passage_51_425268168","msmarco_passage_51_425269073","msmarco_passage_51_425269934","msmarco_passage_52_239985649","msmarco_passage_52_239988585","msmarco_passage_55_153268398","msmarco_passage_55_602655827","msmarco_passage_57_49061407","msmarco_passage_57_50031449","msmarco_passage_57_50035708","msmarco_passage_57_50037310","msmarco_passage_58_39423436","msmarco_passage_58_39423896","msmarco_passage_58_39424363","msmarco_passage_58_670545493","msmarco_passage_61_256896606","msmarco_passage_62_104556715","msmarco_passage_62_567932067","msmarco_passage_62_568154858","msmarco_passage_62_568341973","msmarco_passage_62_568342428","msmarco_passage_62_568342936","msmarco_passage_63_34604683","msmarco_passage_63_34605095","msmarco_passage_63_34611889","msmarco_passage_64_187303355","msmarco_passage_64_187304616","msmarco_passage_64_373471586","msmarco_passage_64_373472118","msmarco_passage_68_38020681"]}

When a small blood vessel under the skin bursts, it can produce a sharp, stabbing pain that can be felt in the affected area. This pain is often described as a dull ache or a throbbing sensation.\n\nThe feeling of a popped blood vessel in the hand can also be accompanied by redness and swelling around the affected area. In some cases, the skin may appear more sensitive to touch than usual, making it feel warm or tender to the touch.\n\nIt's worth noting that the sensation of a popped blood vessel can vary from person to person, and not everyone will experience the same level of discomfort. If you're experiencing recurring or persistent pain in your hands, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment.\n\nIn general, if you suspect that you have a popped blood vessel in your hand, you may feel:\n\n* A sharp, stabbing pain in the affected area\n* Redness and swelling around the burst vessel\n* Sensitivity to touch or pressure on the skin\n* Warmth or tenderness in the affected area\n\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, it's best to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment.","dids":["msmarco_passage_07_15157280","msmarco_passage_07_468943998","msmarco_passage_07_641466322","msmarco_passage_08_425122071","msmarco_passage_08_50732364","msmarco_passage_08_50732736","msmarco_passage_08_50733260","msmarco_passage_08_50734547","msmarco_passage_08_537938064","msmarco_passage_08_58851329","msmarco_passage_08_58852531","msmarco_passage_09_484017797","msmarco_passage_09_484020174","msmarco_passage_09_484020537","msmarco_passage_09_484020911","msmarco_passage_09_484021526","msmarco_passage_09_484021871","msmarco_passage_09_484022308","msmarco_passage_09_484023542","msmarco_passage_09_690022724","msmarco_passage_09_791162327","msmarco_passage_09_791177763","msmarco_passage_09_791177980","msmarco_passage_09_791178425","msmarco_passage_09_791178797","msmarco_passage_09_791179299","msmarco_passage_11_2846072","msmarco_passage_15_183419564","msmarco_passage_19_451582527","msmarco_passage_24_148953535","msmarco_passage_24_418680136","msmarco_passage_26_720334501","msmarco_passage_27_610355255","msmarco_passage_35_96712306","msmarco_passage_35_97801556","msmarco_passage_35_97802189","msmarco_passage_35_97802537","msmarco_passage_35_97803886","msmarco_passage_35_97804366","msmarco_passage_35_97806706","msmarco_passage_35_97807275","msmarco_passage_35_97807825","msmarco_passage_35_97809480","msmarco_passage_35_97809978","msmarco_passage_35_97810421","msmarco_passage_35_97810880","msmarco_passage_35_97811882","msmarco_passage_35_97812837","msmarco_passage_35_97813720","msmarco_passage_35_97814235","msmarco_passage_35_97815855","msmarco_passage_35_97816320","msmarco_passage_35_97817172","msmarco_passage_35_97818450","msmarco_passage_35_97818881","msmarco_passage_35_97819308","msmarco_passage_35_97819879","msmarco_passage_35_98010201","msmarco_passage_39_119423024","msmarco_passage_39_119423447","msmarco_passage_42_14446680","msmarco_passage_45_321216369","msmarco_passage_45_321218197","msmarco_passage_48_849331681","msmarco_passage_49_70895728","msmarco_passage_52_464930065","msmarco_passage_52_594335069","msmarco_passage_53_430851938","msmarco_passage_53_430852310","msmarco_passage_53_430852834","msmarco_passage_53_430854121","msmarco_passage_53_431816122","msmarco_passage_53_431816906","msmarco_passage_53_444376291","msmarco_passage_53_444377493","msmarco_passage_55_278426472","msmarco_passage_55_291746437","msmarco_passage_59_52165039","msmarco_passage_60_676297795","msmarco_passage_60_676300172","msmarco_passage_60_676300535","msmarco_passage_60_676300909","msmarco_passage_60_676301524","msmarco_passage_60_676301869","msmarco_passage_60_676302306","msmarco_passage_60_676303540","msmarco_passage_61_706775831","msmarco_passage_62_95660551","msmarco_passage_62_95660767","msmarco_passage_62_95661211","msmarco_passage_62_95661582","msmarco_passage_64_656909934","msmarco_passage_64_656911576","msmarco_passage_65_748292513","msmarco_passage_66_116159896","msmarco_passage_66_763731306","msmarco_passage_67_717813386"]}

care is a comprehensive series of medical check-ups and services provided to pregnant women before, during, and after childbirth. It plays a vital role in ensuring the health and well-being of both the mother and the baby. During prenatal care, a woman's healthcare provider establishes a rapport with her to discuss any concerns, answer questions, and provide education on pregnancy-related topics.\n\nPrenatal care includes a range of services, such as:\n\n1. Regular check-ups: A series of scheduled visits to monitor the health and growth of the fetus and the mother.\n2. Physical examinations: Each visit typically involves a physical examination, including taking vital signs, checking blood pressure, conducting a pelvic exam (if necessary), and assessing overall health.\n3. Ultrasound monitoring: Routine ultrasound scans are performed to assess fetal development, detect potential issues, and track growth.\n4. Prenatal testing: Various tests may be ordered, such as group B strep testing, HIV screening, and maternal serology for syphilis and hepatitis B.\n5. Education and counseling: A woman receives personalized guidance on healthy pregnancy habits, breastfeeding techniques, and parenting skills.\n6. Nutrition and lifestyle advice: Her healthcare provider advises on a balanced diet, healthy eating, and exercise routines that support her health and the baby's development.\n7. Screening for pregnancy complications: Tests are performed to identify potential risks or conditions, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, or placenta previa.\n8. Birth planning: A woman creates a birth plan, outlining her preferences regarding the delivery process, pain management options, and newborn care.\n\nThroughout prenatal care, the healthcare provider tracks fetal development and addresses any concerns that may arise. This comprehensive approach ensures a healthy pregnancy outcome for both mother and baby.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_433924377","msmarco_passage_00_546996726","msmarco_passage_00_546998685","msmarco_passage_01_117683522","msmarco_passage_01_829085303","msmarco_passage_02_755402826","msmarco_passage_05_548448771","msmarco_passage_05_548450120","msmarco_passage_05_548452099","msmarco_passage_06_274740091","msmarco_passage_06_274740552","msmarco_passage_06_450899513","msmarco_passage_06_727300897","msmarco_passage_06_765034498","msmarco_passage_07_74136555","msmarco_passage_07_74138242","msmarco_passage_07_74138634","msmarco_passage_07_74139026","msmarco_passage_07_74141990","msmarco_passage_07_760959786","msmarco_passage_08_24551781","msmarco_passage_08_24559278","msmarco_passage_08_24643970","msmarco_passage_08_24649884","msmarco_passage_08_467471364","msmarco_passage_08_467471786","msmarco_passage_08_467472178","msmarco_passage_09_36276994","msmarco_passage_09_36279712","msmarco_passage_09_36596108","msmarco_passage_10_629293268","msmarco_passage_10_629300156","msmarco_passage_10_629766498","msmarco_passage_10_630639482","msmarco_passage_10_630753359","msmarco_passage_10_687224391","msmarco_passage_11_89874559","msmarco_passage_14_853672414","msmarco_passage_20_474276629","msmarco_passage_20_474279199","msmarco_passage_20_474280232","msmarco_passage_20_474282454","msmarco_passage_20_474289658","msmarco_passage_20_474293306","msmarco_passage_21_671680957","msmarco_passage_21_684832884","msmarco_passage_21_684835454","msmarco_passage_21_684836487","msmarco_passage_22_798004588","msmarco_passage_22_825524449","msmarco_passage_24_626811987","msmarco_passage_26_236478713","msmarco_passage_27_528589105","msmarco_passage_27_614004243","msmarco_passage_27_614992448","msmarco_passage_27_626193109","msmarco_passage_27_626193579","msmarco_passage_27_789816202","msmarco_passage_28_313167712","msmarco_passage_28_313169904","msmarco_passage_28_813659266","msmarco_passage_30_7771798","msmarco_passage_30_7772264","msmarco_passage_30_7772566","msmarco_passage_30_7772949","msmarco_passage_35_103063096","msmarco_passage_35_103067535","msmarco_passage_35_395489672","msmarco_passage_36_190414509","msmarco_passage_36_190423590","msmarco_passage_36_207491884","msmarco_passage_36_207493904","msmarco_passage_36_207498071","msmarco_passage_36_207498432","msmarco_passage_36_414631631","msmarco_passage_37_36647802","msmarco_passage_38_630197409","msmarco_passage_42_581880558","msmarco_passage_43_355682519","msmarco_passage_43_355703802","msmarco_passage_43_355704448","msmarco_passage_43_355704853","msmarco_passage_44_455236393","msmarco_passage_47_609742201","msmarco_passage_47_609747966","msmarco_passage_47_660635221","msmarco_passage_48_748303131","msmarco_passage_48_748304818","msmarco_passage_48_748306294","msmarco_passage_48_749998273","msmarco_passage_49_610464550","msmarco_passage_49_610466237","msmarco_passage_49_610467021","msmarco_passage_49_610469985","msmarco_passage_50_254102779","msmarco_passage_53_125746457","msmarco_passage_53_125872395","msmarco_passage_53_126546442","msmarco_passage_53_126657894","msmarco_passage_53_126658424","msmarco_passage_53_126666476","msmarco_passage_53_126666945","msmarco_passage_53_253592504","msmarco_passage_53_355369296","msmarco_passage_53_355454477","msmarco_passage_53_355459800","msmarco_passage_53_589963884","msmarco_passage_53_590996709","msmarco_passage_53_592569309","msmarco_passage_53_607453911","msmarco_passage_53_607454387","msmarco_passage_55_257186745","msmarco_passage_55_39773413","msmarco_passage_55_423361532","msmarco_passage_55_423361954","msmarco_passage_55_423362346","msmarco_passage_55_423403591","msmarco_passage_55_423404013","msmarco_passage_55_423404405","msmarco_passage_55_423407775","msmarco_passage_55_423408197","msmarco_passage_55_423408589","msmarco_passage_55_574286847","msmarco_passage_57_184774554","msmarco_passage_57_184775023","msmarco_passage_57_184775328","msmarco_passage_57_184775714","msmarco_passage_57_184777147","msmarco_passage_59_580806021","msmarco_passage_59_580811532","msmarco_passage_60_491818497","msmarco_passage_60_491821147","msmarco_passage_64_685043870","msmarco_passage_65_455436891","msmarco_passage_66_119411167","msmarco_passage_66_627096373","msmarco_passage_66_627571814","msmarco_passage_66_733417331","msmarco_passage_67_172913145","msmarco_passage_67_37817668","msmarco_passage_67_37826749","msmarco_passage_67_822962800","msmarco_passage_68_8978015","msmarco_passage_68_9338147"]}

It stands for \"as needed per\" and is often seen on prescription labels or in medical instructions.\n\nWhen a doctor prescribes a medication with an \"s\/p\" notation, it means that the patient should take the medication as needed, without regular dosing schedules. This can be due to various reasons such as:\n\n* The patient has a specific condition that requires intermittent treatment\n* The medication is used to manage symptoms rather than treat a chronic condition\n* The patient needs to monitor their body's response to the medication and adjust dosage accordingly\n\nFor example, if a doctor prescribes \"s\/p ibuprofen 400mg\" as needed for headaches, it means the patient should take 400mg of ibuprofen whenever they experience a headache.

you have asthma, it's essential to be mindful of the foods you consume, as some can trigger or exacerbate symptoms. Here are some common culprits to limit or avoid:\n\n1. **Dairy products**: Milk, cheese, and ice cream contain a protein called casein, which can stimulate mucus production and worsen asthma symptoms.\n2. **Eggs**: Eggs are another common allergen that can trigger asthma attacks in some individuals.\n3. **Nuts and seeds**: While nuts and seeds are nutritious, they can cause inflammation and airway constriction in people with asthma. Common culprits include peanuts, tree nuts (like walnuts and almonds), sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds.\n4. **Fish and shellfish**: Some fish and shellfish, such as salmon, tuna, and shrimp, contain a protein called histamine, which can trigger asthma symptoms.\n5. **Soy products**: Soy contains a compound called isoflavones, which can cause inflammation and worsen asthma in some individuals.\n6. **Spicy foods**: Spicy foods like chili peppers, wasabi, and horseradish can irritate the airways and trigger asthma symptoms.\n7. **Caffeine**: Caffeine can constrict blood vessels and reduce mucus production, which may worsen asthma symptoms.\n8. **Processed meats**: Processed meats like hot dogs, sausages, and bacon contain preservatives that can exacerbate asthma symptoms.\n9. **Refined sugars**: Consuming high amounts of refined sugars can lead to inflammation and worsen asthma symptoms.\n10. **Foods high in histamine**: Foods like fermented foods (like cheese, wine, and beer), citrus fruits, and tomatoes contain high levels of histamine, which can trigger asthma attacks.\n\nIt's essential to note that everyone's body is different, and what triggers asthma symptoms for one person may not be the same for another. If you have asthma, it's best to consult with your healthcare provider or registered dietitian to develop a personalized nutrition plan that minimizes potential triggers.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_226159488","msmarco_passage_01_263231202","msmarco_passage_01_471731652","msmarco_passage_01_512659356","msmarco_passage_02_258062627","msmarco_passage_04_522262527","msmarco_passage_05_830588101","msmarco_passage_06_414689293","msmarco_passage_06_752786402","msmarco_passage_07_459640004","msmarco_passage_07_459640406","msmarco_passage_07_459640819","msmarco_passage_07_459641243","msmarco_passage_07_592492956","msmarco_passage_07_691670285","msmarco_passage_07_691671039","msmarco_passage_07_691672736","msmarco_passage_07_691673119","msmarco_passage_07_704394253","msmarco_passage_07_704395144","msmarco_passage_07_866210453","msmarco_passage_07_866210788","msmarco_passage_08_352299541","msmarco_passage_08_357280296","msmarco_passage_08_95584857","msmarco_passage_09_269093780","msmarco_passage_09_270325536","msmarco_passage_09_270335993","msmarco_passage_09_272968400","msmarco_passage_09_274647485","msmarco_passage_09_274656480","msmarco_passage_09_275621628","msmarco_passage_09_277611327","msmarco_passage_09_279810682","msmarco_passage_09_279819894","msmarco_passage_09_282561795","msmarco_passage_09_285028468","msmarco_passage_10_628641186","msmarco_passage_10_628644455","msmarco_passage_10_628749529","msmarco_passage_10_628749918","msmarco_passage_10_824051214","msmarco_passage_11_705296362","msmarco_passage_13_707907453","msmarco_passage_13_712849885","msmarco_passage_13_712851025","msmarco_passage_13_712854286","msmarco_passage_15_804758947","msmarco_passage_15_806662419","msmarco_passage_15_808075727","msmarco_passage_15_808311968","msmarco_passage_15_808312333","msmarco_passage_15_808518131","msmarco_passage_15_810455013","msmarco_passage_15_811343786","msmarco_passage_15_812262307","msmarco_passage_15_813007604","msmarco_passage_15_813447711","msmarco_passage_15_814101614","msmarco_passage_15_814574660","msmarco_passage_15_815317155","msmarco_passage_15_816494547","msmarco_passage_15_817022523","msmarco_passage_15_817921732","msmarco_passage_16_689871194","msmarco_passage_16_689871674","msmarco_passage_16_689872113","msmarco_passage_17_120561114","msmarco_passage_21_60121737","msmarco_passage_21_60130083","msmarco_passage_23_439659441","msmarco_passage_23_439972669","msmarco_passage_24_131375757","msmarco_passage_24_136323001","msmarco_passage_24_157954460","msmarco_passage_24_192912201","msmarco_passage_24_201257738","msmarco_passage_24_247762454","msmarco_passage_24_267590472","msmarco_passage_26_186871582","msmarco_passage_28_256277717","msmarco_passage_28_801153727","msmarco_passage_28_806084280","msmarco_passage_29_463560599","msmarco_passage_31_161925968","msmarco_passage_31_496282715","msmarco_passage_32_297035372","msmarco_passage_33_22087469","msmarco_passage_33_22089585","msmarco_passage_33_22094189","msmarco_passage_34_388986571","msmarco_passage_34_556478754","msmarco_passage_38_642898398","msmarco_passage_44_284217718","msmarco_passage_44_315409908","msmarco_passage_44_382776129","msmarco_passage_44_382799923","msmarco_passage_44_383684161","msmarco_passage_44_384090364","msmarco_passage_44_384092547","msmarco_passage_44_386592301","msmarco_passage_44_386822702","msmarco_passage_44_389592219","msmarco_passage_44_390960734","msmarco_passage_44_392792931","msmarco_passage_44_394467527","msmarco_passage_44_400243002","msmarco_passage_44_400249526","msmarco_passage_44_401562715","msmarco_passage_44_404319882","msmarco_passage_44_405455212","msmarco_passage_44_405659530","msmarco_passage_44_405888108","msmarco_passage_44_407719333","msmarco_passage_44_407900202","msmarco_passage_44_408019432","msmarco_passage_44_410914892","msmarco_passage_44_411006641","msmarco_passage_44_411183954","msmarco_passage_44_411940087","msmarco_passage_44_412211002","msmarco_passage_44_413553010","msmarco_passage_44_415139204","msmarco_passage_44_415259503","msmarco_passage_44_415403346","msmarco_passage_44_416504705","msmarco_passage_44_416513705","msmarco_passage_44_417462912","msmarco_passage_44_418555733","msmarco_passage_44_420780034","msmarco_passage_44_420782653","msmarco_passage_44_421803201","msmarco_passage_44_422629973","msmarco_passage_44_424759555","msmarco_passage_44_427529113","msmarco_passage_44_428867418","msmarco_passage_44_428891954","msmarco_passage_44_445605493","msmarco_passage_45_594591372","msmarco_passage_45_614782813","msmarco_passage_47_715842873","msmarco_passage_48_389906080","msmarco_passage_48_617267828","msmarco_passage_48_617268288","msmarco_passage_48_617269101","msmarco_passage_48_617270053","msmarco_passage_48_629237295","msmarco_passage_48_633752299","msmarco_passage_48_633754114","msmarco_passage_48_633755019","msmarco_passage_48_664678588","msmarco_passage_48_668137775","msmarco_passage_49_36627133","msmarco_passage_52_176697973","msmarco_passage_52_204535809","msmarco_passage_53_332248795","msmarco_passage_53_541760550","msmarco_passage_53_612079244","msmarco_passage_54_106325319","msmarco_passage_55_830920460","msmarco_passage_55_83092974

In this scenario, the judge will typically hear evidence presented by both spouses through documents, witness testimony, and other exhibits, without requiring either party to physically present themselves in court.\n\nDuring a bench trial, each side presents its case, usually with the assistance of an attorney, who prepares arguments, witnesses, and evidence to support their client's claims. The judge then reviews all the evidence presented and makes a decision on the key issues in dispute, such as child custody, spousal support, property division, and other divorce-related matters.\n\nUnlike a traditional trial where both parties are present and can cross-examine each other's witnesses, a bench trial is often used when one spouse is absent due to illness, travel, or other reasons that make it impractical for them to appear in court. In some cases, a bench trial may be chosen by the parties themselves as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to a traditional trial.\n\nThe outcome of a divorce bench trial can be similar to a traditional trial, with the judge making a decision based on the evidence presented. However, because one party is not present in court, there is less opportunity for them to respond to questions or counterarguments from their spouse's attorney.\n\nOverall, a divorce bench trial provides a flexible and efficient way for couples to resolve their disputes without requiring both parties to appear in court together.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_250927262","msmarco_passage_01_863512789","msmarco_passage_02_93043008","msmarco_passage_03_174169627","msmarco_passage_03_174171869","msmarco_passage_03_174176284","msmarco_passage_03_430670923","msmarco_passage_03_465199087","msmarco_passage_03_654736370","msmarco_passage_04_631100051","msmarco_passage_05_186565876","msmarco_passage_05_340088407","msmarco_passage_05_368788716","msmarco_passage_06_821773522","msmarco_passage_07_576705546","msmarco_passage_07_576705909","msmarco_passage_07_595816132","msmarco_passage_07_784475446","msmarco_passage_07_784475816","msmarco_passage_07_784478867","msmarco_passage_07_784479248","msmarco_passage_07_784480053","msmarco_passage_08_196185747","msmarco_passage_09_396999225","msmarco_passage_10_884375586","msmarco_passage_14_193732083","msmarco_passage_14_243085159","msmarco_passage_15_51351061","msmarco_passage_16_414279279","msmarco_passage_16_89948829","msmarco_passage_17_186185973","msmarco_passage_18_125290508","msmarco_passage_18_125292472","msmarco_passage_18_125293047","msmarco_passage_21_361812005","msmarco_passage_22_248922098","msmarco_passage_22_324896993","msmarco_passage_22_338118265","msmarco_passage_26_350028203","msmarco_passage_26_350030768","msmarco_passage_26_440158803","msmarco_passage_26_440267747","msmarco_passage_26_451487483","msmarco_passage_26_617923666","msmarco_passage_27_830044725","msmarco_passage_29_655338857","msmarco_passage_31_49628802","msmarco_passage_31_526732464","msmarco_passage_33_127479767","msmarco_passage_33_127482009","msmarco_passage_33_127486424","msmarco_passage_35_100574180","msmarco_passage_36_478513288","msmarco_passage_38_18609716","msmarco_passage_38_542548004","msmarco_passage_38_542549817","msmarco_passage_38_546112553","msmarco_passage_39_26067529","msmarco_passage_41_518852776","msmarco_passage_41_518853218","msmarco_passage_41_589324667","msmarco_passage_41_589328343","msmarco_passage_42_671383984","msmarco_passage_42_671386550","msmarco_passage_42_671388162","msmarco_passage_42_761247083","msmarco_passage_43_262386310","msmarco_passage_43_73627374","msmarco_passage_43_777320993","msmarco_passage_45_320349337","msmarco_passage_46_372224732","msmarco_passage_46_867438444","msmarco_passage_47_35489261","msmarco_passage_49_123208220","msmarco_passage_49_123208798","msmarco_passage_49_852828141","msmarco_passage_50_255012135","msmarco_passage_51_520734464","msmarco_passage_52_157010218","msmarco_passage_52_157013533","msmarco_passage_52_298036480","msmarco_passage_53_848640098","msmarco_passage_54_682199648","msmarco_passage_58_342068065","msmarco_passage_58_723562223","msmarco_passage_60_597781856","msmarco_passage_61_833413224","msmarco_passage_61_833423084","msmarco_passage_65_416314142"]}

The name \"kanima\" is derived from the Swahili word for termites, which are social insects known for their distinctive behavior and unique characteristics.\n\nKanimas are members of the Rhinotermitidae family and are typically found in soil, wood, or plant material. They are highly social creatures that live in large colonies with a complex hierarchy, led by a single queen termite. Kanimas feed on cellulose-based materials such as wood, plant fibers, and even paper products.\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of kanimas is their unique method of movement. Unlike ants or bees, which use legs to move around, kanimas are able to slide along surfaces using specialized tubes in their bodies called \"glands\". These glands secrete a sticky liquid that allows the termites to glide smoothly over surfaces, making them formidable navigators.\n\nKanimas have also been known to play an important role in ecosystems, serving as both predators and prey for other insects and animals. However, they can also be significant pests, causing damage to buildings, wood structures, and agricultural crops through their feeding activities.\n\nIn some cultures, kanimas are considered a delicacy and are consumed as a source of protein, particularly in Asia where they are often served fried or boiled. Despite their potential benefits, however, kanimas remain a significant pest species in many parts of the world, making it essential for humans to understand their behavior and ecology in order to mitigate their impact on the environment.","dids":["msmarco_passage_03_266476938","msmarco_passage_03_266477381","msmarco_passage_03_266477686","msmarco_passage_03_266478313","msmarco_passage_03_266478684","msmarco_passage_03_266479480","msmarco_passage_03_266480358","msmarco_passage_03_266482578","msmarco_passage_03_266483061","msmarco_passage_03_266483487","msmarco_passage_03_266484400","msmarco_passage_03_266484801","msmarco_passage_03_266485238","msmarco_passage_03_266485642","msmarco_passage_03_266486053","msmarco_passage_03_266486863","msmarco_passage_03_266489211","msmarco_passage_03_267536517","msmarco_passage_03_267538317","msmarco_passage_03_267539605","msmarco_passage_03_267541408","msmarco_passage_03_267541845","msmarco_passage_03_267542256","msmarco_passage_03_267542735","msmarco_passage_03_267543295","msmarco_passage_03_267543739","msmarco_passage_09_852014369","msmarco_passage_09_852058189","msmarco_passage_09_852058652","msmarco_passage_09_852059190","msmarco_passage_09_852059577","msmarco_passage_09_852060003","msmarco_passage_09_852061308","msmarco_passage_09_852064267","msmarco_passage_09_852065060","msmarco_passage_09_852065491","msmarco_passage_09_852065874","msmarco_passage_19_403425039","msmarco_passage_31_739159592","msmarco_passage_31_739160025","msmarco_passage_33_763167006","msmarco_passage_33_763211618","msmarco_passage_33_763341442","msmarco_passage_33_763605332","msmarco_passage_33_766597212","msmarco_passage_33_766598147","msmarco_passage_33_766599118","msmarco_passage_33_766600925","msmarco_passage_33_766601363","msmarco_passage_33_766601775","msmarco_passage_33_766602216","msmarco_passage_33_766602775","msmarco_passage_33_766603220","msmarco_passage_33_766666707","msmarco_passage_59_14445923","msmarco_passage_59_14446298","msmarco_passage_59_14447608"]}

the context of body composition, LBMI stands for Low Body Mass Index. It refers to a body mass index (BMI) score below 18.5, which indicates underweight or thinness. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines LBMI as a BMI that is lower than 18.5 kg\/m\u00b2.\n\nTo calculate LBMI, you can use the following formula:\n\nLBMI = weight (in kg) \/ height (in meters)\u00b2\n\nFor example, if an individual weighs 50 kg and stands at 1.65 meters tall, their LBMI would be approximately 16.7 kg\/m\u00b2, indicating they are underweight.\n\nIt's essential to note that while a low BMI may not necessarily be associated with negative health consequences for everyone, it can pose certain risks, such as:\n\n- Fatigue and weakness\n- Poor immune function\n- Osteoporosis (weakened bones)\n- Decreased muscle mass and strength\n\nLBMI is often used in clinical settings to identify individuals who are at risk of malnutrition or other health problems related to underweight status. Healthcare professionals may recommend a healthy weight range, dietary changes, and regular monitoring to ensure the individual's overall health and well-being.\n\nKeep in mind that BMI is not always an accurate measure of body fatness or health, particularly for athletes or individuals with muscular builds. In such cases, other measures like body fat percentage or waist circumference might be more suitable indicators of overall health.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_550264801","msmarco_passage_01_550266280","msmarco_passage_02_209383207","msmarco_passage_02_209383842","msmarco_passage_03_765618379","msmarco_passage_04_643485673","msmarco_passage_04_675504147","msmarco_passage_04_675504650","msmarco_passage_04_675505125","msmarco_passage_04_675511673","msmarco_passage_04_675554691","msmarco_passage_04_675602524","msmarco_passage_04_675619373","msmarco_passage_04_675824335","msmarco_passage_04_722722682","msmarco_passage_07_511776613","msmarco_passage_09_23259327","msmarco_passage_10_407484430","msmarco_passage_11_49495459","msmarco_passage_14_21567905","msmarco_passage_14_21569736","msmarco_passage_14_21570906","msmarco_passage_14_21571364","msmarco_passage_14_421123636","msmarco_passage_14_421124929","msmarco_passage_14_421125312","msmarco_passage_14_421126113","msmarco_passage_14_421126623","msmarco_passage_14_421127144","msmarco_passage_14_421128852","msmarco_passage_14_421129291","msmarco_passage_14_421129754","msmarco_passage_14_421130213","msmarco_passage_14_421131161","msmarco_passage_14_421132060","msmarco_passage_14_421134707","msmarco_passage_14_423028674","msmarco_passage_15_291511137","msmarco_passage_17_501552228","msmarco_passage_17_501554141","msmarco_passage_17_501555126","msmarco_passage_17_501555921","msmarco_passage_18_181640995","msmarco_passage_19_596453214","msmarco_passage_19_596453747","msmarco_passage_19_596454365","msmarco_passage_19_596455227","msmarco_passage_19_596456042","msmarco_passage_21_668258929","msmarco_passage_21_668259462","msmarco_passage_21_668260080","msmarco_passage_21_668260942","msmarco_passage_21_668261757","msmarco_passage_22_335678507","msmarco_passage_22_335678975","msmarco_passage_22_335679414","msmarco_passage_23_520220303","msmarco_passage_23_520221613","msmarco_passage_23_752141572","msmarco_passage_23_752149798","msmarco_passage_23_752150101","msmarco_passage_23_752150814","msmarco_passage_23_752151221","msmarco_passage_23_752152017","msmarco_passage_23_752154375","msmarco_passage_23_752154678","msmarco_passage_23_752155391","msmarco_passage_23_752155798","msmarco_passage_23_752156594","msmarco_passage_23_806696199","msmarco_passage_24_293474499","msmarco_passage_24_293475974","msmarco_passage_25_498024196","msmarco_passage_25_498045233","msmarco_passage_25_498081178","msmarco_passage_25_498243777","msmarco_passage_25_498270562","msmarco_passage_25_498281634","msmarco_passage_25_498282024","msmarco_passage_25_498284382","msmarco_passage_25_498288524","msmarco_passage_25_498289798","msmarco_passage_25_498354963","msmarco_passage_25_498432234","msmarco_passage_25_856491012","msmarco_passage_26_182794069","msmarco_passage_26_182794717","msmarco_passage_26_352847528","msmarco_passage_27_431753051","msmarco_passage_29_668164433","msmarco_passage_30_491515440","msmarco_passage_30_491515780","msmarco_passage_30_491516332","msmarco_passage_30_731727333","msmarco_passage_30_738556199","msmarco_passage_31_354444076","msmarco_passage_33_566043171","msmarco_passage_33_852706340","msmarco_passage_34_504632763","msmarco_passage_37_18340783","msmarco_passage_38_53225537","msmarco_passage_39_707555831","msmarco_passage_39_707556886","msmarco_passage_39_707558714","msmarco_passage_39_707559901","msmarco_passage_39_707560328","msmarco_passage_39_707564037","msmarco_passage_39_711201217","msmarco_passage_40_251191524","msmarco_passage_40_253767765","msmarco_passage_40_253768267","msmarco_passage_40_253768741","msmarco_passage_40_253775274","msmarco_passage_40_253819046","msmarco_passage_40_253900849","msmarco_passage_40_255061882","msmarco_passage_40_512427116","msmarco_passage_41_267966562","msmarco_passage_42_691449377","msmarco_passage_42_691449767","msmarco_passage_46_406218554","msmarco_passage_46_406219022","msmarco_passage_47_619580096","msmarco_passage_50_459571864","msmarco_passage_50_459572255","msmarco_passage_50_459574618","msmarco_passage_50_459578770","msmarco_passage_50_459580047","msmarco_passage_50_459586659","msmarco_passage_51_328534969","msmarco_passage_51_764909851","msmarco_passage_51_764927566","msmarco_passage_53_478805141","msmarco_passage_53_478810787","msmarco_passage_54_599889784","msmarco_passage_54_753002734","msmarco_passage_54_753002997","msmarco_passage_54_753003355","msmarco_passage_54_753004653","msmarco_passage_54_753005697","msmarco_passage_57_778066188","msmarco_passage_58_30820770","msmarco_passage_59_363705814","msmarco_passage_60_30084160","msmarco_passage_60_30350358","msmarco_passage_60_483171928","msmarco_passage_60_756199040","msmarco_passage_64_597917960","msmarco_passage_65_795086408","msmarco_passage_65_818906913","msmarco_passage_65_819663733","msmarco_passage_65_839705386","msmarco_passage_66_30708880","msmarco_passage_66_35303805","msmarco_passage_66_35429894","msmarco_passage_66_39928087","msmarco_passage_66_839813043","msmarco_passage_67_782096032","msmarco_passage_67_782096472"]}

The main difference between the two lies in their design, functionality, and intended use.\n\nRange Rover is designed for luxury, comfort, and versatility, with an emphasis on ruggedness and off-road capability. It is built on a more substantial platform, featuring a higher ground clearance (up to 11 inches) and a longer wheelbase (126.7 inches), making it better suited for long-distance travel, camping, and navigating challenging terrain. The Range Rover's body-on-frame design provides a higher center of gravity, which enhances its stability in rough conditions.\n\nIn contrast, the Range Rover Sport is a more agile and sporty variant, designed to prioritize on-road performance and handling. It features a unibody construction with a lower ground clearance (8-9 inches) and a shorter wheelbase (118.3 inches), making it better suited for everyday driving and urban excursions. While still capable of navigating rough terrain, the Range Rover Sport is more focused on comfort and refinement.\n\nAnother key difference between the two models lies in their interior space and features. The Range Rover offers more passenger and cargo capacity, with a larger cabin and more storage compartments. In contrast, the Range Rover Sport has a more compact and sporty interior, prioritizing driver-centric ergonomics and premium materials.\n\nFinally, both vehicles come equipped with advanced technologies such as advanced infotainment systems, driver assistance features, and off-road capabilities, but the Range Rover Sport tends to have a slightly more limited range of available options and packages.\n\nUltimately, the choice between the Range Rover and the Range Rover Sport depends on your priorities: if you value luxury, versatility, and ruggedness, the Range Rover may be the better choice. If you prioritize agility, comfort, and urban performance, the Range Rover Sport is likely a better fit.","dids":["msmarco_passage_03_488675808","msmarco_passage_03_488676174","msmarco_passage_03_488686530","msmarco_passage_03_488686945","msmarco_passage_04_167143329","msmarco_passage_04_218845177","msmarco_passage_04_759194640","msmarco_passage_04_759219504","msmarco_passage_04_759223242","msmarco_passage_05_259696243","msmarco_passage_05_696857246","msmarco_passage_05_696860563","msmarco_passage_07_548481351","msmarco_passage_07_548495555","msmarco_passage_07_548630868","msmarco_passage_07_548632067","msmarco_passage_10_348048910","msmarco_passage_10_41748877","msmarco_passage_10_41750153","msmarco_passage_14_602257483","msmarco_passage_14_602257899","msmarco_passage_14_602332658","msmarco_passage_14_602333503","msmarco_passage_14_602333976","msmarco_passage_14_602367400","msmarco_passage_14_602367767","msmarco_passage_14_602458418","msmarco_passage_14_602490859","msmarco_passage_14_607759820","msmarco_passage_14_607763231","msmarco_passage_14_607767570","msmarco_passage_22_794020864","msmarco_passage_38_486659386","msmarco_passage_38_486660617","msmarco_passage_38_486661344","msmarco_passage_38_492156110","msmarco_passage_38_494073483","msmarco_passage_38_494073980","msmarco_passage_38_494074410","msmarco_passage_38_494074721","msmarco_passage_38_494075120","msmarco_passage_38_494076038","msmarco_passage_38_494076531","msmarco_passage_38_494077936","msmarco_passage_38_494078439","msmarco_passage_38_494079263","msmarco_passage_38_494079562","msmarco_passage_38_494079979","msmarco_passage_38_494080479","msmarco_passage_38_494081062","msmarco_passage_38_494081789","msmarco_passage_38_498013421","msmarco_passage_40_674925296","msmarco_passage_40_674982859","msmarco_passage_40_674986589","msmarco_passage_40_674987408","msmarco_passage_40_674992520","msmarco_passage_44_757676816","msmarco_passage_44_757711640","msmarco_passage_44_757725395","msmarco_passage_47_384741325","msmarco_passage_47_384743429","msmarco_passage_51_621383745","msmarco_passage_52_22498664","msmarco_passage_52_22499993","msmarco_passage_52_22500357","msmarco_passage_52_22500753","msmarco_passage_52_22511157","msmarco_passage_52_22512824","msmarco_passage_52_22513654","msmarco_passage_52_22515431","msmarco_passage_52_22656831","msmarco_passage_53_178264440","msmarco_passage_54_416508841","msmarco_passage_54_416510142","msmarco_passage_54_416510609","msmarco_passage_54_416511632","msmarco_passage_54_416512054","msmarco_passage_54_416512531","msmarco_passage_55_256554245","msmarco_passage_55_256559794","msmarco_passage_55_256611496","msmarco_passage_55_256616850","msmarco_passage_55_256618646","msmarco_passage_58_406620390","msmarco_passage_58_406623350","msmarco_passage_58_406626439","msmarco_passage_62_780881596","msmarco_passage_65_25881930"]}

Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) and Adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) Test, also known as the Methylmalonic Acid and Cobalamin Metabolic Pathway Test or MMA\/AdoCbl Test, is a diagnostic tool used to assess the function of cobalamin (vitamin B12), a crucial nutrient for the body's metabolic processes.\n\nIn this test, blood samples are collected and analyzed to measure the levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). MMA is an intermediate product in a metabolic pathway that requires cobalamin as a cofactor. The presence of cobalamin enables the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to convert MMA into succinyl-CoA, a key step in energy production.\n\nIf there is a deficiency in vitamin B12 or a problem with its metabolism, MMA levels will be elevated. This can occur due to various reasons such as:\n\n* Vitamin B12 deficiency\n* Malabsorption of vitamin B12 (e.g., from celiac disease or gastric surgery)\n* Genetic disorders affecting cobalamin metabolism (e.g., adenosylcobalamin deficiency)\n* Certain medications that interfere with cobalamin absorption\n\nAdditionally, the MMA\/AdoCbl Test can also detect abnormalities in the adenosylcobalamin pathway, which is involved in energy production and other metabolic processes.\n\nThe test results are used to diagnose various conditions, including:\n\n* Vitamin B12 deficiency\n* Adenosylcobalamin deficiency\n* Malabsorption syndromes (e.g., celiac disease)\n* Certain genetic disorders affecting cobalamin metabolism\n\nBy measuring MMA and AdoCbl levels, healthcare providers can identify potential deficiencies or abnormalities in vitamin B12 metabolism, allowing for early diagnosis and treatment.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_273235767","msmarco_passage_02_97515931","msmarco_passage_02_98991136","msmarco_passage_03_719841793","msmarco_passage_04_289508824","msmarco_passage_04_652471247","msmarco_passage_04_652471715","msmarco_passage_04_652472437","msmarco_passage_04_652472890","msmarco_passage_04_652474540","msmarco_passage_06_127448718","msmarco_passage_06_127458893","msmarco_passage_06_3120005","msmarco_passage_06_3269926","msmarco_passage_06_3270368","msmarco_passage_06_762877157","msmarco_passage_06_762877693","msmarco_passage_06_762878514","msmarco_passage_06_762879377","msmarco_passage_06_762879865","msmarco_passage_06_762881318","msmarco_passage_06_762882567","msmarco_passage_06_762884274","msmarco_passage_06_762884584","msmarco_passage_06_771703068","msmarco_passage_06_775887422","msmarco_passage_08_248391751","msmarco_passage_08_31192223","msmarco_passage_12_495658596","msmarco_passage_17_357440061","msmarco_passage_17_357440508","msmarco_passage_18_860671966","msmarco_passage_18_860687508","msmarco_passage_18_860721736","msmarco_passage_18_862989787","msmarco_passage_20_44542517","msmarco_passage_21_488344473","msmarco_passage_21_656135292","msmarco_passage_24_203994696","msmarco_passage_24_205383441","msmarco_passage_24_205384369","msmarco_passage_24_205385166","msmarco_passage_24_205385941","msmarco_passage_24_205386715","msmarco_passage_24_205387559","msmarco_passage_24_205389529","msmarco_passage_24_205390176","msmarco_passage_24_205391769","msmarco_passage_26_372734184","msmarco_passage_26_372735585","msmarco_passage_26_372736506","msmarco_passage_26_372740938","msmarco_passage_26_372741755","msmarco_passage_26_377021482","msmarco_passage_26_377385151","msmarco_passage_26_377385596","msmarco_passage_26_377388002","msmarco_passage_26_377391036","msmarco_passage_26_378685846","msmarco_passage_26_384249140","msmarco_passage_26_384257416","msmarco_passage_26_384265692","msmarco_passage_26_384273968","msmarco_passage_26_385062537","msmarco_passage_26_385062982","msmarco_passage_26_385065388","msmarco_passage_26_385073075","msmarco_passage_26_385075481","msmarco_passage_26_388173402","msmarco_passage_26_388184884","msmarco_passage_26_388196366","msmarco_passage_27_612379643","msmarco_passage_27_612382169","msmarco_passage_27_623962221","msmarco_passage_27_623966954","msmarco_passage_27_623967352","msmarco_passage_27_96091596","msmarco_passage_27_99103483","msmarco_passage_28_560816826","msmarco_passage_31_854283766","msmarco_passage_31_854285170","msmarco_passage_31_854290536","msmarco_passage_31_854291355","msmarco_passage_32_587653705","msmarco_passage_33_33410848","msmarco_passage_35_589599547","msmarco_passage_36_742282742","msmarco_passage_36_856824266","msmarco_passage_36_856824602","msmarco_passage_36_856824989","msmarco_passage_36_856825277","msmarco_passage_36_856825738","msmarco_passage_38_598846699","msmarco_passage_38_599104239","msmarco_passage_38_599241550","msmarco_passage_41_669589885","msmarco_passage_44_156208796","msmarco_passage_44_615851504","msmarco_passage_44_615971619","msmarco_passage_44_615977775","msmarco_passage_44_616052972","msmarco_passage_44_616053416","msmarco_passage_45_185903075","msmarco_passage_45_185913228","msmarco_passage_47_361069892","msmarco_passage_47_87603488","msmarco_passage_48_735874891","msmarco_passage_48_735875426","msmarco_passage_48_735876245","msmarco_passage_48_735877106","msmarco_passage_48_735879043","msmarco_passage_48_735880289","msmarco_passage_48_735881992","msmarco_passage_48_735882301","msmarco_passage_48_867940102","msmarco_passage_51_860235163","msmarco_passage_51_860428166","msmarco_passage_51_860433569","msmarco_passage_51_860838587","msmarco_passage_51_862121454","msmarco_passage_53_362876623","msmarco_passage_53_362890623","msmarco_passage_53_364302257","msmarco_passage_53_364316257","msmarco_passage_54_470408875","msmarco_passage_58_735292157","msmarco_passage_59_207803404","msmarco_passage_65_477257870","msmarco_passage_65_479670438","msmarco_passage_66_363021488","msmarco_passage_66_363022020","msmarco_passage_66_363022785"]}

The vesical triangle plays a significant role in urology, particularly during surgical procedures involving the bladder, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or bladder surgery for cancer.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_825429320","msmarco_passage_00_825433416","msmarco_passage_00_839984182","msmarco_passage_00_839984630","msmarco_passage_01_156757005","msmarco_passage_01_156762605","msmarco_passage_01_156766438","msmarco_passage_02_116371085","msmarco_passage_02_116371556","msmarco_passage_02_229034087","msmarco_passage_02_230563351","msmarco_passage_02_230564083","msmarco_passage_02_230564860","msmarco_passage_02_230565338","msmarco_passage_02_230565823","msmarco_passage_02_231667412","msmarco_passage_03_256570544","msmarco_passage_03_256574218","msmarco_passage_03_406876512","msmarco_passage_03_406876905","msmarco_passage_04_126981328","msmarco_passage_04_126981769","msmarco_passage_04_156883639","msmarco_passage_04_156884151","msmarco_passage_04_175933290","msmarco_passage_04_182393001","msmarco_passage_05_517223372","msmarco_passage_06_384396776","msmarco_passage_06_745589480","msmarco_passage_07_409117210","msmarco_passage_07_409124963","msmarco_passage_07_409144511","msmarco_passage_07_43774988","msmarco_passage_08_318648522","msmarco_passage_08_787082193","msmarco_passage_09_122474192","msmarco_passage_10_475298126","msmarco_passage_10_475374905","msmarco_passage_10_475380765","msmarco_passage_10_475381700","msmarco_passage_10_618455500","msmarco_passage_12_833050844","msmarco_passage_13_410111776","msmarco_passage_14_104830071","msmarco_passage_15_564167560","msmarco_passage_15_564171045","msmarco_passage_15_588172240","msmarco_passage_15_588174433","msmarco_passage_15_597607798","msmarco_passage_15_597609970","msmarco_passage_15_603448235","msmarco_passage_15_603451720","msmarco_passage_21_362250737","msmarco_passage_21_637884974","msmarco_passage_21_699341642","msmarco_passage_22_218957334","msmarco_passage_22_218957742","msmarco_passage_22_465099929","msmarco_passage_22_465100299","msmarco_passage_22_465100713","msmarco_passage_22_465101176","msmarco_passage_22_465101587","msmarco_passage_24_210169319","msmarco_passage_24_223806817","msmarco_passage_25_117780954","msmarco_passage_25_809064713","msmarco_passage_25_809072484","msmarco_passage_27_221421544","msmarco_passage_27_221422017","msmarco_passage_27_516158708","msmarco_passage_27_516165286","msmarco_passage_27_516166182","msmarco_passage_27_516166956","msmarco_passage_27_516167433","msmarco_passage_27_516167918","msmarco_passage_27_516854178","msmarco_passage_28_781805823","msmarco_passage_28_789430552","msmarco_passage_29_164262160","msmarco_passage_29_164263044","msmarco_passage_29_187007204","msmarco_passage_29_187008872","msmarco_passage_29_482632351","msmarco_passage_30_586049326","msmarco_passage_30_607597264","msmarco_passage_30_607848505","msmarco_passage_30_609662475","msmarco_passage_30_610562030","msmarco_passage_30_658254028","msmarco_passage_30_680429824","msmarco_passage_30_698152991","msmarco_passage_30_728838154","msmarco_passage_30_748998703","msmarco_passage_30_848266581","msmarco_passage_33_619952164","msmarco_passage_33_619955838","msmarco_passage_35_627704571","msmarco_passage_35_799500616","msmarco_passage_36_709181864","msmarco_passage_42_533042728","msmarco_passage_44_589632773","msmarco_passage_44_589658608","msmarco_passage_44_589665110","msmarco_passage_46_424085011","msmarco_passage_48_634009764","msmarco_passage_48_641225972","msmarco_passage_49_475803879","msmarco_passage_49_477740527","msmarco_passage_49_477745542","msmarco_passage_51_275780383","msmarco_passage_51_275788154","msmarco_passage_51_275797742","msmarco_passage_51_653230622","msmarco_passage_51_653235770","msmarco_passage_51_653249795","msmarco_passage_51_653251153","msmarco_passage_53_850483474","msmarco_passage_55_315261634","msmarco_passage_56_847733738","msmarco_passage_56_856299571","msmarco_passage_56_859123513","msmarco_passage_57_246173236","msmarco_passage_58_363814381","msmarco_passage_60_157085187","msmarco_passage_60_814093193","msmarco_passage_61_589104954","msmarco_passage_61_679330071","msmarco_passage_64_587780076","msmarco_passage_64_587780470","msmarco_passage_66_231585209","msmarco_passage_67_816726896"]}

It is a sacrament that confers an individual's priestly vows and enables them to serve God and His people in a specific role.\n\nThe sacrament of Service involves the laying on of hands by a bishop or other authorized priest, which conveys the authority and responsibility that comes with serving as a priest. This sacrament binds the recipient to a lifetime commitment to the service of the Church and its members. The sacrament is typically conferred upon individuals who have been called by God to serve in a particular role, such as a priest or deacon.\n\nThe purpose of the sacrament of Service is to empower the individual to fulfill their vocation, which is their unique calling from God. This calling may be to serve as a priest, deacon, or bishop, but it can also involve other forms of service, such as marriage and parenthood. The sacrament of Service is seen as a means of expressing one's love and devotion to God and serving others in the way that Christ served.\n\nThe sacrament of Service is often celebrated through the ordination ceremony, where the candidate receives the oil of holy orders and is consecrated by the bishop or other authorized priest. This ceremony typically includes prayers, readings from Scripture and the catechism, and a blessing after which the candidate is anointed with the oil of holy orders.\n\nIn summary, the sacrament of Service in the Catholic Church is a sacrament that confers vocation to serve God and His people in a specific role. It empowers individuals to fulfill their unique calling from God and serves as a means of expressing one's love and devotion to God and serving others in Christ's name.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_649801203","msmarco_passage_01_649802047","msmarco_passage_03_739047042","msmarco_passage_04_788124909","msmarco_passage_04_788125704","msmarco_passage_06_611756102","msmarco_passage_06_96269758","msmarco_passage_06_96270236","msmarco_passage_08_349100844","msmarco_passage_09_688521130","msmarco_passage_09_688526102","msmarco_passage_09_688526904","msmarco_passage_09_703142068","msmarco_passage_09_703142476","msmarco_passage_09_703143266","msmarco_passage_10_489485093","msmarco_passage_10_521130068","msmarco_passage_11_339322740","msmarco_passage_11_676755663","msmarco_passage_11_676757889","msmarco_passage_14_468167561","msmarco_passage_14_658892045","msmarco_passage_15_495007795","msmarco_passage_15_495009012","msmarco_passage_15_84220903","msmarco_passage_15_86619930","msmarco_passage_15_96734512","msmarco_passage_15_98664933","msmarco_passage_17_519647753","msmarco_passage_18_449954113","msmarco_passage_20_678896438","msmarco_passage_20_678907540","msmarco_passage_20_678954233","msmarco_passage_20_679155299","msmarco_passage_20_679166403","msmarco_passage_20_679166836","msmarco_passage_20_679167826","msmarco_passage_20_679177999","msmarco_passage_20_679178850","msmarco_passage_20_679182829","msmarco_passage_22_468881411","msmarco_passage_24_657546200","msmarco_passage_31_473878569","msmarco_passage_31_474011040","msmarco_passage_31_474011488","msmarco_passage_31_474012312","msmarco_passage_31_474014499","msmarco_passage_31_474014999","msmarco_passage_32_179127206","msmarco_passage_32_201082945","msmarco_passage_32_201091108","msmarco_passage_32_625987683","msmarco_passage_32_625989322","msmarco_passage_32_828629891","msmarco_passage_33_96493256","msmarco_passage_34_450951873","msmarco_passage_34_59594835","msmarco_passage_34_59595668","msmarco_passage_34_59596195","msmarco_passage_34_59598021","msmarco_passage_34_59598491","msmarco_passage_34_59640285","msmarco_passage_38_189802295","msmarco_passage_38_189811815","msmarco_passage_38_189814851","msmarco_passage_39_106530415","msmarco_passage_39_6500426","msmarco_passage_40_9070969","msmarco_passage_41_20382800","msmarco_passage_41_23731212","msmarco_passage_41_23731561","msmarco_passage_41_23732354","msmarco_passage_41_41065121","msmarco_passage_41_486570381","msmarco_passage_45_155031272","msmarco_passage_45_155033382","msmarco_passage_45_155033601","msmarco_passage_47_85469645","msmarco_passage_52_241833380","msmarco_passage_52_246108062","msmarco_passage_52_770996849","msmarco_passage_52_770997296","msmarco_passage_53_195190207","msmarco_passage_56_793374220","msmarco_passage_58_289733144","msmarco_passage_58_289733618","msmarco_passage_58_289735902","msmarco_passage_58_582888826","msmarco_passage_58_582896549","msmarco_passage_61_223522827","msmarco_passage_61_459271781","msmarco_passage_61_459272250","msmarco_passage_61_674413319","msmarco_passage_63_597359901","msmarco_passage_65_362622354","msmarco_passage_65_554637961","msmarco_passage_65_715451412","msmarco_passage_68_133561828","msmarco_passage_68_87209129","msmarco_passage_68_87214939"]}

The battle took place near a small farm owned by John Bull Run, which is now part of the city of Manassas, Virginia.\n\nOn that summer day in 1861, Confederate forces led by General P.G.T. Beauregard clashed with Union forces under the command of Brigadier General Irvin McDowell in a pivotal battle that would determine the fate of the American Civil War. The battle was fought on two separate fronts: the main battlefield at Manassas Station, where the two armies faced off directly, and a smaller skirmish near Bull Run Creek, which took place farther to the east.\n\nDespite being outnumbered by the Union army, the Confederate forces were able to repel the attack and ultimately emerge victorious. The Battle of Manassas was a decisive victory for the Confederacy, marking the first major land battle of the American Civil War and setting the stage for future conflicts in the region.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_564032982","msmarco_passage_00_565084975","msmarco_passage_00_565303701","msmarco_passage_01_116824152","msmarco_passage_01_116824619","msmarco_passage_01_151330516","msmarco_passage_01_834283452","msmarco_passage_01_99279153","msmarco_passage_02_278496278","msmarco_passage_03_170308132","msmarco_passage_03_297361060","msmarco_passage_03_399019105","msmarco_passage_03_400788839","msmarco_passage_04_128069419","msmarco_passage_04_153443643","msmarco_passage_04_18518977","msmarco_passage_04_200650608","msmarco_passage_04_220638989","msmarco_passage_04_220640380","msmarco_passage_04_222437049","msmarco_passage_04_327777306","msmarco_passage_05_133283894","msmarco_passage_05_841752010","msmarco_passage_06_143738194","msmarco_passage_06_166613342","msmarco_passage_06_166613829","msmarco_passage_06_166615369","msmarco_passage_06_236227959","msmarco_passage_06_839603877","msmarco_passage_06_850241564","msmarco_passage_08_846390135","msmarco_passage_10_556768432","msmarco_passage_12_165297346","msmarco_passage_12_286820844","msmarco_passage_12_286830552","msmarco_passage_14_149947376","msmarco_passage_17_642045950","msmarco_passage_18_835152501","msmarco_passage_18_835474705","msmarco_passage_18_835483239","msmarco_passage_18_835483610","msmarco_passage_18_835485671","msmarco_passage_18_835486139","msmarco_passage_18_836618865","msmarco_passage_19_836382936","msmarco_passage_19_836383404","msmarco_passage_20_729548348","msmarco_passage_21_757271857","msmarco_passage_21_757272669","msmarco_passage_21_757273899","msmarco_passage_23_702331640","msmarco_passage_26_521351650","msmarco_passage_26_538415378","msmarco_passage_26_538422322","msmarco_passage_27_757755313","msmarco_passage_30_703729481","msmarco_passage_30_746805562","msmarco_passage_34_73212009","msmarco_passage_34_806832578","msmarco_passage_35_528501965","msmarco_passage_38_378953467","msmarco_passage_38_51849807","msmarco_passage_38_51851317","msmarco_passage_40_148012392","msmarco_passage_40_90587857","msmarco_passage_40_92890431","msmarco_passage_41_590614578","msmarco_passage_41_591275177","msmarco_passage_44_478663803","msmarco_passage_45_272067275","msmarco_passage_45_272074389","msmarco_passage_45_272074878","msmarco_passage_45_272075199","msmarco_passage_45_272076426","msmarco_passage_45_272090219","msmarco_passage_49_225979544","msmarco_passage_49_244766726","msmarco_passage_55_640587270","msmarco_passage_55_651353914","msmarco_passage_57_182250236","msmarco_passage_63_337829867","msmarco_passage_63_337841297","msmarco_passage_64_126254942","msmarco_passage_64_153448817","msmarco_passage_68_148620030"]}

From June to October, these species migrate through the waters off Cape Cod and the Islands, making them easy targets for tourists.\n\nThe peak season for whale watching in Massachusetts typically falls between July and September, when the ocean temperatures are warmest (around 60-70\u00b0F) and the food supply is abundant. During this time, humpback whales can be seen breaching and lobtailing, while finback and minke whales swim alongside boats or feed on krill.\n\nIn particular, the months of July and August offer ideal conditions for whale watching in Massachusetts, with clear skies, calm seas, and a high likelihood of spotting multiple species. It's not uncommon for tourists to see humpback whales giving birth or nursing their young during this time, making it a truly unforgettable experience.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the peak season can also coincide with the height of summer tourist traffic, which may lead to larger crowds and longer boat lines. If you're looking for a more intimate whale-watching experience, consider visiting in June or September, when the weather is still pleasant but the crowds are smaller.\n\nRegardless of when you plan your whale-watching excursion, be sure to choose a reputable tour operator that prioritizes responsible wildlife viewing practices and respect for these magnificent creatures.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_169186683","msmarco_passage_02_85129069","msmarco_passage_03_424879522","msmarco_passage_03_424880023","msmarco_passage_03_424880963","msmarco_passage_03_424881978","msmarco_passage_03_424886315","msmarco_passage_03_424887607","msmarco_passage_03_806522687","msmarco_passage_03_806530124","msmarco_passage_06_405843958","msmarco_passage_08_318054068","msmarco_passage_08_318054544","msmarco_passage_08_332800131","msmarco_passage_08_398544432","msmarco_passage_08_421102337","msmarco_passage_10_366853374","msmarco_passage_12_65586608","msmarco_passage_14_477499580","msmarco_passage_14_477501414","msmarco_passage_14_477502805","msmarco_passage_14_477503267","msmarco_passage_14_477505370","msmarco_passage_14_477506673","msmarco_passage_14_477507485","msmarco_passage_14_477507948","msmarco_passage_14_477508456","msmarco_passage_14_477508947","msmarco_passage_14_500067633","msmarco_passage_14_500068870","msmarco_passage_14_500070092","msmarco_passage_14_500070495","msmarco_passage_14_500071328","msmarco_passage_16_12518676","msmarco_passage_18_584654166","msmarco_passage_27_14074335","msmarco_passage_30_439206743","msmarco_passage_31_370483698","msmarco_passage_31_370485379","msmarco_passage_31_370485825","msmarco_passage_31_370487027","msmarco_passage_31_370487411","msmarco_passage_31_370487884","msmarco_passage_31_370489558","msmarco_passage_31_370489867","msmarco_passage_31_370490406","msmarco_passage_31_370490747","msmarco_passage_31_370540601","msmarco_passage_31_370546131","msmarco_passage_34_813983670","msmarco_passage_34_813989829","msmarco_passage_35_31385135","msmarco_passage_35_520950963","msmarco_passage_35_61731466","msmarco_passage_35_61731967","msmarco_passage_35_61732457","msmarco_passage_35_61733187","msmarco_passage_35_61734202","msmarco_passage_35_61735507","msmarco_passage_35_61737501","msmarco_passage_35_61738353","msmarco_passage_37_192015174","msmarco_passage_37_192022593","msmarco_passage_38_73849586","msmarco_passage_38_73851921","msmarco_passage_38_73852385","msmarco_passage_38_73854069","msmarco_passage_38_73856707","msmarco_passage_39_233858464","msmarco_passage_39_233859377","msmarco_passage_39_233863891","msmarco_passage_39_233864336","msmarco_passage_39_233864805","msmarco_passage_42_4467073","msmarco_passage_42_448588587","msmarco_passage_49_440854483","msmarco_passage_53_207239703","msmarco_passage_53_207240185","msmarco_passage_53_248942772","msmarco_passage_54_800252270","msmarco_passage_54_800252753","msmarco_passage_54_800253094","msmarco_passage_55_151966205","msmarco_passage_55_266300323","msmarco_passage_57_174388827","msmarco_passage_60_349909265","msmarco_passage_60_349910448","msmarco_passage_60_349910753","msmarco_passage_64_226882001","msmarco_passage_64_696793428","msmarco_passage_64_696794037","msmarco_passage_64_800220542","msmarco_passage_64_812645788","msmarco_passage_64_812650549","msmarco_passage_64_812651059","msmarco_passage_64_825880780","msmarco_passage_64_829524653","msmarco_passage_64_865564458","msmarco_passage_66_186283170","msmarco_passage_67_1060757","msmarco_passage_67_1061224","msmarco_passage_67_1624530","msmarco_passage_67_44902538","msmarco_passage_67_44904878","msmarco_passage_67_44905343","msmarco_passage_67_44907031","msmarco_passage_67_44909675","msmarco_passage_68_209726995","msmarco_passage_68_46427854"]}

it comes to taking a home pregnancy urine test, timing is everything. The ideal time to take a home pregnancy test (HPT) varies depending on several factors, including the sensitivity of the test and individual fertility. Generally, it's recommended to wait at least 10-14 days after conception for the most accurate results.\n\nFor first-time mothers, this means waiting until about two weeks after a missed period, when the hCG levels in urine have reached their peak. However, some women may ovulate before they get pregnant or experience implantation before their period is late. In these cases, it's best to wait until around 6-8 days after conception.\n\nFor those who are trying to conceive, timing matters more. If you're trying regularly and using fertility-friendly methods like tracking ovulation, fertility apps can help pinpoint the optimal time for taking a home pregnancy test. Many women take a HPT on the day of their missed period or about 10-14 days later.\n\nIt's essential to consider the sensitivity level of your HPT when determining the best time for testing. More sensitive tests (e.g., First Response, E.P.T.) can detect higher hCG levels earlier than less sensitive ones (e.g., Clear Blue). If you're trying to conceive or suspect pregnancy, it's better to take a test sooner rather than later to avoid false negatives.\n\nRemember that home pregnancy tests are not always 100% accurate, especially in the early stages of pregnancy. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and consider consulting your healthcare provider for guidance on when to take a HPT and how to interpret the results.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_137327187","msmarco_passage_00_137330162","msmarco_passage_00_137352249","msmarco_passage_00_137357668","msmarco_passage_00_138091560","msmarco_passage_00_183419164","msmarco_passage_00_239612976","msmarco_passage_02_181110358","msmarco_passage_02_181112366","msmarco_passage_02_390596085","msmarco_passage_02_641464125","msmarco_passage_02_641464293","msmarco_passage_02_641464678","msmarco_passage_02_641465025","msmarco_passage_02_641465329","msmarco_passage_02_641466124","msmarco_passage_02_641467190","msmarco_passage_02_641467638","msmarco_passage_03_463140564","msmarco_passage_03_764143400","msmarco_passage_03_8215607","msmarco_passage_04_373883289","msmarco_passage_04_374534646","msmarco_passage_04_374939340","msmarco_passage_04_375241745","msmarco_passage_04_375260282","msmarco_passage_04_375310446","msmarco_passage_04_375310833","msmarco_passage_04_375312147","msmarco_passage_04_375314037","msmarco_passage_04_477738807","msmarco_passage_04_84678409","msmarco_passage_05_387234180","msmarco_passage_06_197758296","msmarco_passage_06_370520781","msmarco_passage_06_789705806","msmarco_passage_07_478202684","msmarco_passage_07_506859894","msmarco_passage_07_760965505","msmarco_passage_07_761033793","msmarco_passage_08_121212749","msmarco_passage_08_217461491","msmarco_passage_08_23334122","msmarco_passage_08_23341339","msmarco_passage_08_426454619","msmarco_passage_08_426455483","msmarco_passage_08_426699428","msmarco_passage_08_462423950","msmarco_passage_08_50860341","msmarco_passage_08_61246098","msmarco_passage_08_69164212","msmarco_passage_08_711619846","msmarco_passage_08_711622466","msmarco_passage_08_714771715","msmarco_passage_09_36067691","msmarco_passage_09_36565547","msmarco_passage_10_629329837","msmarco_passage_10_630335283","msmarco_passage_10_886522396","msmarco_passage_11_823084759","msmarco_passage_11_823089134","msmarco_passage_11_8858858","msmarco_passage_14_777008092","msmarco_passage_14_789147369","msmarco_passage_17_97045571","msmarco_passage_22_508549330","msmarco_passage_22_590724126","msmarco_passage_22_590727458","msmarco_passage_22_590730851","msmarco_passage_24_214564207","msmarco_passage_24_246139215","msmarco_passage_24_246140967","msmarco_passage_24_246141435","msmarco_passage_24_246146361","msmarco_passage_24_299687350","msmarco_passage_25_131136165","msmarco_passage_25_132037486","msmarco_passage_27_150071581","msmarco_passage_27_464765209","msmarco_passage_27_612555233","msmarco_passage_28_37164819","msmarco_passage_28_467873805","msmarco_passage_29_147415208","msmarco_passage_29_460300967","msmarco_passage_29_468411739","msmarco_passage_31_192361612","msmarco_passage_34_772695569","msmarco_passage_35_333920753","msmarco_passage_35_335144532","msmarco_passage_35_335168030","msmarco_passage_35_472983324","msmarco_passage_35_472983684","msmarco_passage_35_777782600","msmarco_passage_36_112066186","msmarco_passage_36_112302911","msmarco_passage_36_112396967","msmarco_passage_36_158567210","msmarco_passage_36_158567631","msmarco_passage_36_158568641","msmarco_passage_36_158569935","msmarco_passage_36_325858411","msmarco_passage_37_592337592","msmarco_passage_38_518614745","msmarco_passage_38_607573076","msmarco_passage_38_632151469","msmarco_passage_38_632152284","msmarco_passage_38_632156574","msmarco_passage_38_632243235","msmarco_passage_38_632441362","msmarco_passage_38_633543190","msmarco_passage_38_634253392","msmarco_passage_38_635601500","msmarco_passage_38_635601888","msmarco_passage_38_635605099","msmarco_passage_39_118844285","msmarco_passage_39_98630259","msmarco_passage_39_99197132","msmarco_passage_40_465570404","msmarco_passage_40_515445277","msmarco_passage_41_623946512","msmarco_passage_41_623952358","msmarco_passage_42_239571720","msmarco_passage_42_435271130","msmarco_passage_42_857904295","msmarco_passage_44_540245844","msmarco_passage_44_566824764","msmarco_passage_44_567000444","msmarco_passage_45_471492115","msmarco_passage_46_197909458","msmarco_passage_46_370746889","msmarco_passage_46_370765247","msmarco_passage_46_370834828","msmarco_passage_48_676879309","msmarco_passage_48_711072622","msmarco_passage_48_749209638","msmarco_passage_48_749890435","msmarco_passage_48_750280267","msmarco_passage_48_753200302","msmarco_passage_48_774362860","msmarco_passage_48_830387392","msmarco_passage_48_838301481","msmarco_passage_48_843189234","msmarco_passage_48_848507310","msmarco_passage_49_6123050","msmarco_passage_49_70173791","msmarco_passage_51_539870701","msmarco_passage_51_730377922","msmarco_passage_53_354094593","msmarco_passage_53_354101810","msmarco_passage_53_472328997","msmarco_passage_53_472330829","msmarco_passage_53_472331209","msmarco_passage_53_472336135","msmarco_passage_53_472337967","msmarco_passage_53_472338347","msmarco_passage_53_636626110","msmarco_passage_54_180855902","msmarco_passage_54_180866174","msmarco_passage_54_180892695","msmarco_passage_54_180896345","msmarco_passage_54_240610679","msmarco_p

When it comes to determining the best time to use this type of bait, there are several factors to consider.\n\nIn general, crawfish color bait works well in shallow waters with a gentle current, such as ponds, reservoirs, and slow-moving streams. The ideal conditions for using crawfish color bait are during the spring and early summer months when fish are actively feeding on baitfish and other small prey.\n\nDuring this time, bass, panfish, and catfish tend to congregate in areas with abundant vegetation, structure, and food sources. Crawfish color bait is particularly effective for targeting these species when they are holding in or near areas such as:\n\n1. Weed beds: Fish often hide among the dense growth of aquatic plants, where crawfish color bait can be presented to them with a gentle tug.\n2. Sunken logs or trees: Damaged or sunken timber can provide a hiding spot for fish, and crawfish color bait can be used to entice them out from their hiding places.\n3. Drop-offs: Fish often congregate near the transition zones between shallow and deeper waters, where crawfish color bait can be presented with a subtle presentation.\n\nIn terms of specific fishing times, consider using crawfish color bait during:\n\n1. Early morning or late afternoon: These periods often coincide with the peak feeding hours for bass and panfish.\n2. Overcast days: Fish tend to feed more actively when the sun is not shining directly down on them, making overcast days ideal for using crawfish color bait.\n3. With a slow current: A gentle flow of water can help mimic the movement of a live crawdad, increasing the chances of attracting a strike.\n\nBy understanding these factors and adjusting your fishing schedule accordingly, you can increase your chances of landing a trophy with crawfish color bait.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_318212844","msmarco_passage_00_794070232","msmarco_passage_00_794071843","msmarco_passage_00_794073178","msmarco_passage_01_435480020","msmarco_passage_04_65469004","msmarco_passage_07_835173591","msmarco_passage_09_390248815","msmarco_passage_09_781930615","msmarco_passage_11_288630511","msmarco_passage_14_244042171","msmarco_passage_15_650401688","msmarco_passage_15_650402943","msmarco_passage_22_520040168","msmarco_passage_22_520040926","msmarco_passage_22_520041432","msmarco_passage_22_520041923","msmarco_passage_22_520042337","msmarco_passage_22_520042735","msmarco_passage_22_520043293","msmarco_passage_22_520221287","msmarco_passage_22_522653000","msmarco_passage_22_850719698","msmarco_passage_22_850847499","msmarco_passage_22_850848447","msmarco_passage_22_850848937","msmarco_passage_22_850851091","msmarco_passage_22_850851981","msmarco_passage_22_850852408","msmarco_passage_22_850852975","msmarco_passage_22_850853407","msmarco_passage_22_850855121","msmarco_passage_22_850856014","msmarco_passage_22_850856447","msmarco_passage_22_850857260","msmarco_passage_22_850857705","msmarco_passage_22_851689201","msmarco_passage_22_851693279","msmarco_passage_23_607074779","msmarco_passage_27_110289987","msmarco_passage_32_131930975","msmarco_passage_32_132108456","msmarco_passage_32_132398653","msmarco_passage_32_493090764","msmarco_passage_33_539236141","msmarco_passage_33_864306932","msmarco_passage_33_864309229","msmarco_passage_36_726687505","msmarco_passage_38_844649848","msmarco_passage_38_844692838","msmarco_passage_38_846139030","msmarco_passage_38_846164575","msmarco_passage_38_846335755","msmarco_passage_38_846346539","msmarco_passage_38_846350271","msmarco_passage_43_715301109","msmarco_passage_46_382445692","msmarco_passage_46_383671956","msmarco_passage_53_700312764","msmarco_passage_59_332439486","msmarco_passage_59_332439949","msmarco_passage_59_332440410","msmarco_passage_59_332441542","msmarco_passage_59_332441873","msmarco_passage_60_744014637","msmarco_passage_61_373096056","msmarco_passage_62_65975544","msmarco_passage_64_829866829","msmarco_passage_66_366478569"]}

The origins of the Welsh language are closely tied to the ancient Celtic culture of Great Britain.\n\nIt is believed that the earliest forms of the Welsh language evolved from the common Celtic tongue spoken throughout much of Europe during the Iron Age (around 500 BCE to 100 CE). As the Roman Empire expanded its territories, it brought its own languages and cultures into contact with those of the indigenous Celtic-speaking peoples. Over time, these early Celtic dialects developed distinct features that would eventually become the foundations of the Welsh language.\n\nThe earliest written records of the Welsh language date back to the 6th century CE, when Christian missionaries from Ireland and other parts of Europe began to convert the native Celtic-speaking populations of Britain to Christianity. The Vulgate Latin Bible, which was translated into Welsh in the 6th century, is one of the oldest surviving examples of written Welsh.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the modern Welsh language has undergone significant changes over the centuries due to various historical events and cultural influences. The Norman Conquest of England in 1066 CE introduced French and Latin loanwords into the English language, which had a profound impact on the development of the Welsh language as well.\n\nDespite these external influences, the Welsh language remained distinctively Celtic and maintained many of its ancient features throughout the Middle Ages. In fact, the medieval Welsh literary tradition, including works such as the Mabinogion, is some of the oldest surviving Welsh literature and showcases the rich cultural heritage of the Welsh people.\n\nToday, the Welsh language continues to be spoken by around 700,000 people in Wales, with efforts being made to preserve and promote its unique cultural identity. As a result, the Welsh language remains an important part of the country's history, culture, and national identity.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_37958444","msmarco_passage_00_518413896","msmarco_passage_02_235579423","msmarco_passage_02_237741003","msmarco_passage_02_44338298","msmarco_passage_04_172650847","msmarco_passage_04_172652249","msmarco_passage_04_172653187","msmarco_passage_04_172653685","msmarco_passage_04_172654189","msmarco_passage_04_428426158","msmarco_passage_04_428427841","msmarco_passage_04_442602590","msmarco_passage_04_665755092","msmarco_passage_04_665756474","msmarco_passage_05_358804474","msmarco_passage_05_358812588","msmarco_passage_05_569337598","msmarco_passage_05_569337956","msmarco_passage_05_688957659","msmarco_passage_06_823901147","msmarco_passage_07_139627355","msmarco_passage_08_329340994","msmarco_passage_08_619797955","msmarco_passage_08_619801653","msmarco_passage_08_708254206","msmarco_passage_10_66057321","msmarco_passage_10_66060908","msmarco_passage_11_171007921","msmarco_passage_12_520523460","msmarco_passage_18_508298739","msmarco_passage_18_643815000","msmarco_passage_19_577300446","msmarco_passage_19_577300903","msmarco_passage_19_577883138","msmarco_passage_19_577903463","msmarco_passage_19_577903920","msmarco_passage_19_577988376","msmarco_passage_19_577988833","msmarco_passage_20_22882197","msmarco_passage_20_338496762","msmarco_passage_21_533459632","msmarco_passage_21_533460091","msmarco_passage_21_533467006","msmarco_passage_21_533472489","msmarco_passage_21_533505371","msmarco_passage_21_533512470","msmarco_passage_23_842446551","msmarco_passage_27_354311357","msmarco_passage_29_76686471","msmarco_passage_29_76690161","msmarco_passage_32_179218821","msmarco_passage_32_179219181","msmarco_passage_32_199723450","msmarco_passage_32_199897726","msmarco_passage_34_121735585","msmarco_passage_34_122507568","msmarco_passage_35_323507761","msmarco_passage_35_323508167","msmarco_passage_35_326235499","msmarco_passage_38_29077078","msmarco_passage_38_600963492","msmarco_passage_39_7640982","msmarco_passage_40_157215370","msmarco_passage_40_157216466","msmarco_passage_40_157216931","msmarco_passage_40_157217384","msmarco_passage_40_30716671","msmarco_passage_43_390666598","msmarco_passage_43_390666956","msmarco_passage_43_488190540","msmarco_passage_43_529067971","msmarco_passage_43_585816245","msmarco_passage_54_617841535","msmarco_passage_57_852433917","msmarco_passage_58_151026443","msmarco_passage_58_259083082","msmarco_passage_58_259090442","msmarco_passage_58_518024804","msmarco_passage_59_773341087","msmarco_passage_63_71739158","msmarco_passage_68_160730821"]}

The primary visual cortex (V1), located in the occipital lobe, is responsible for initial visual processing and transmission of sensory data from the retina to higher-level areas for interpretation.\n\nHowever, it is the lateral occipital complex (LOC) within the temporal lobe that plays a critical role in visual perception, particularly in recognizing shapes, objects, and their spatial relationships. The LOC includes several key structures: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), which processes visual-motor integration; the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), involved in visual attention and object recognition; and the lateral occipito-temporal area (LOTA), responsible for recognizing shapes and objects.\n\nDamage to these regions can lead to visual agnosia, a condition characterized by impaired ability to recognize objects or patterns. The temporal lobe's involvement in visual processing underscores its complex role in integrating sensory information from multiple sources, including vision, to create our subjective experience of the world around us.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_341391249","msmarco_passage_00_341393780","msmarco_passage_00_379970616","msmarco_passage_00_435161770","msmarco_passage_00_435471821","msmarco_passage_00_435472619","msmarco_passage_00_435477316","msmarco_passage_00_435478666","msmarco_passage_00_435479481","msmarco_passage_00_435481692","msmarco_passage_00_805095721","msmarco_passage_01_140043634","msmarco_passage_02_184860075","msmarco_passage_02_195912201","msmarco_passage_02_195935914","msmarco_passage_02_213801600","msmarco_passage_02_221725161","msmarco_passage_02_230827423","msmarco_passage_02_394103777","msmarco_passage_03_161283910","msmarco_passage_04_153667880","msmarco_passage_04_153668638","msmarco_passage_04_153668926","msmarco_passage_04_229067163","msmarco_passage_04_632096926","msmarco_passage_05_330177110","msmarco_passage_07_127685328","msmarco_passage_07_504690378","msmarco_passage_07_864555976","msmarco_passage_09_521471674","msmarco_passage_09_521472108","msmarco_passage_11_40748121","msmarco_passage_11_56743734","msmarco_passage_11_77832565","msmarco_passage_11_77836171","msmarco_passage_11_77836584","msmarco_passage_11_77837569","msmarco_passage_13_369125693","msmarco_passage_13_371632683","msmarco_passage_13_574326454","msmarco_passage_13_692554022","msmarco_passage_14_139425059","msmarco_passage_14_145494280","msmarco_passage_14_160301980","msmarco_passage_14_31422044","msmarco_passage_14_31463194","msmarco_passage_14_31993951","msmarco_passage_15_570118796","msmarco_passage_15_573562743","msmarco_passage_20_262838714","msmarco_passage_20_264746819","msmarco_passage_21_133659269","msmarco_passage_22_139604620","msmarco_passage_22_147694426","msmarco_passage_22_190002572","msmarco_passage_23_51806505","msmarco_passage_25_204364289","msmarco_passage_26_218026277","msmarco_passage_27_425031305","msmarco_passage_27_465647524","msmarco_passage_27_467266021","msmarco_passage_27_479906778","msmarco_passage_27_494991976","msmarco_passage_27_508503067","msmarco_passage_27_517967611","msmarco_passage_27_749801923","msmarco_passage_28_480239335","msmarco_passage_28_480465316","msmarco_passage_28_735490361","msmarco_passage_29_695849998","msmarco_passage_30_298022338","msmarco_passage_30_426973606","msmarco_passage_30_650927909","msmarco_passage_31_592007212","msmarco_passage_31_592540561","msmarco_passage_31_631406084","msmarco_passage_32_480153511","msmarco_passage_32_616103500","msmarco_passage_32_616104552","msmarco_passage_36_708651936","msmarco_passage_39_830286396","msmarco_passage_39_830288473","msmarco_passage_39_830344056","msmarco_passage_41_596129006","msmarco_passage_42_43978243","msmarco_passage_46_445105378","msmarco_passage_48_591233968","msmarco_passage_49_750951120","msmarco_passage_50_186670171","msmarco_passage_50_585852867","msmarco_passage_51_650961363","msmarco_passage_52_227318171","msmarco_passage_54_803505130","msmarco_passage_55_329988089","msmarco_passage_56_604214554","msmarco_passage_57_704674129","msmarco_passage_61_305577539","msmarco_passage_61_305578591","msmarco_passage_64_188331002","msmarco_passage_64_264436637","msmarco_passage_65_225020819","msmarco_passage_65_225025567","msmarco_passage_65_827965155","msmarco_passage_65_861714809","msmarco_passage_66_115931548","msmarco_passage_66_61989928","msmarco_passage_66_84491897","msmarco_passage_67_682144407","msmarco_passage_67_907862915","msmarco_passage_67_916775645"]}

As the highest court in the state's judicial hierarchy, the Florida Supreme Court has the ultimate authority to interpret and apply the state's laws and statutes.\n\nAs such, if a dispute or issue arises that falls under the purview of state law but does not have an applicable federal law, the Florida Supreme Court serves as the final decision-maker. This means that in cases where there is no federal authority to guide them, the court will rely on its own interpretation of the relevant statutes and case law to reach a decision.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court's role as the final arbiter of state law is further reinforced by Article V of the Florida Constitution, which establishes the court as the \"highest judicial tribunal in the state\" and grants it the authority to interpret and apply the state's laws and constitutions.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_638907269","msmarco_passage_01_418446192","msmarco_passage_01_418446550","msmarco_passage_04_111783635","msmarco_passage_06_387220198","msmarco_passage_06_391914297","msmarco_passage_06_395098862","msmarco_passage_15_508634777","msmarco_passage_18_705032043","msmarco_passage_18_854620841","msmarco_passage_18_855178612","msmarco_passage_18_855185430","msmarco_passage_18_855523917","msmarco_passage_18_855527748","msmarco_passage_19_125723743","msmarco_passage_19_125724201","msmarco_passage_19_125724558","msmarco_passage_19_13997610","msmarco_passage_19_489886196","msmarco_passage_19_590704127","msmarco_passage_20_753045394","msmarco_passage_21_289609803","msmarco_passage_21_72930767","msmarco_passage_21_72934589","msmarco_passage_21_72935009","msmarco_passage_21_73132792","msmarco_passage_26_441548227","msmarco_passage_26_441549061","msmarco_passage_26_441549810","msmarco_passage_26_441550689","msmarco_passage_26_672703916","msmarco_passage_31_497389526","msmarco_passage_38_130175090","msmarco_passage_38_130175420","msmarco_passage_40_177206664","msmarco_passage_46_429189483","msmarco_passage_46_429288557","msmarco_passage_46_455954993","msmarco_passage_46_465463084","msmarco_passage_47_499345532","msmarco_passage_62_514650149","msmarco_passage_67_451227923"]}

the life cycle of a bryophyte, such as mosses and liverworts, the gametophytic phase is typically the dominant phase. The gametophyte is the sexual phase that produces gametes (sperm and eggs) for reproduction.\n\nDuring this phase, bryophytes have a relatively long and complex life cycle compared to other plants. They undergo an alternation of generations, where they produce both male and female gametes, and then fuse them to form a zygote. This process is repeated, resulting in the growth of new gametophytic individuals.\n\nThe gametophyte phase is dominant because it produces the next generation of bryophytes that will eventually give rise to sporophytes (the spore-producing phase). The sporophyte phase is shorter-lived and typically disappears after producing spores. In contrast, the gametophyte phase can persist for several years or even decades in some species.\n\nIn general, the dominance of the gametophytic phase in bryophytes is thought to be an adaptation to their environment, allowing them to take advantage of favorable conditions for growth and reproduction, such as abundant light and moisture.

two tectonic plates are moving horizontally past each other, they do not collide or subduct into each other. Instead, they form a type of continental boundary known as an oceanic-continental transform boundary (OCTB) or more commonly referred to as a transform boundary.\n\nAt this type of boundary, the two plates are sliding horizontally against one another, resulting in right-lateral strike-slip faulting. This means that the Earth's crust is being pulled apart at the boundary, and the edges of the two plates are moving away from each other.\n\nExamples of transform boundaries include the San Andreas Fault in California, USA, and the North Anatolian Fault Zone in Turkey. These types of boundaries are characterized by a distinctive pattern of faulting and deformation, with no significant subduction or collision occurring at the boundary.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_171841690","msmarco_passage_00_641429498","msmarco_passage_00_672285818","msmarco_passage_00_787878519","msmarco_passage_00_787880357","msmarco_passage_00_787883905","msmarco_passage_00_787885743","msmarco_passage_00_854611255","msmarco_passage_00_854612899","msmarco_passage_01_158580204","msmarco_passage_01_163358767","msmarco_passage_01_165526953","msmarco_passage_01_219742017","msmarco_passage_01_398138178","msmarco_passage_01_399581151","msmarco_passage_01_401148681","msmarco_passage_01_401699608","msmarco_passage_01_402579215","msmarco_passage_01_807129368","msmarco_passage_01_810860074","msmarco_passage_01_810864322","msmarco_passage_02_448879269","msmarco_passage_02_460671034","msmarco_passage_02_460672600","msmarco_passage_02_460673390","msmarco_passage_02_460683192","msmarco_passage_02_544431271","msmarco_passage_02_822004432","msmarco_passage_03_437652637","msmarco_passage_04_127721315","msmarco_passage_04_152859862","msmarco_passage_04_191648759","msmarco_passage_04_198992281","msmarco_passage_04_198992649","msmarco_passage_04_198992956","msmarco_passage_04_198993267","msmarco_passage_04_198993690","msmarco_passage_04_198994047","msmarco_passage_04_198994522","msmarco_passage_04_198994915","msmarco_passage_04_198995534","msmarco_passage_04_198995962","msmarco_passage_04_199470139","msmarco_passage_04_209167611","msmarco_passage_04_209168145","msmarco_passage_04_209169682","msmarco_passage_04_209171037","msmarco_passage_04_34616188","msmarco_passage_04_85150092","msmarco_passage_05_355778210","msmarco_passage_05_742832697","msmarco_passage_05_742834535","msmarco_passage_05_843191397","msmarco_passage_05_867319797","msmarco_passage_06_280030587","msmarco_passage_06_543828709","msmarco_passage_06_545337098","msmarco_passage_06_545339433","msmarco_passage_06_83891892","msmarco_passage_07_504912452","msmarco_passage_07_505237363","msmarco_passage_07_505239577","msmarco_passage_09_43725648","msmarco_passage_10_561771439","msmarco_passage_11_714769719","msmarco_passage_11_714770694","msmarco_passage_12_226015228","msmarco_passage_12_233473869","msmarco_passage_12_233474783","msmarco_passage_12_534312125","msmarco_passage_12_534312965","msmarco_passage_12_536948109","msmarco_passage_14_150207355","msmarco_passage_15_174264331","msmarco_passage_15_297625999","msmarco_passage_15_590250517","msmarco_passage_16_407724915","msmarco_passage_16_407726749","msmarco_passage_17_122357911","msmarco_passage_17_510276449","msmarco_passage_17_510278683","msmarco_passage_17_96126042","msmarco_passage_17_96127321","msmarco_passage_17_96127751","msmarco_passage_17_96130540","msmarco_passage_17_96227809","msmarco_passage_19_475416662","msmarco_passage_19_753121650","msmarco_passage_22_465106588","msmarco_passage_22_465107528","msmarco_passage_22_468893008","msmarco_passage_22_470521343","msmarco_passage_22_470521780","msmarco_passage_22_471901875","msmarco_passage_22_471903366","msmarco_passage_23_288556993","msmarco_passage_23_290887728","msmarco_passage_23_292595528","msmarco_passage_23_295299599","msmarco_passage_23_295313684","msmarco_passage_23_296103797","msmarco_passage_23_602836538","msmarco_passage_23_604284372","msmarco_passage_23_802015408","msmarco_passage_26_114497080","msmarco_passage_26_239198396","msmarco_passage_28_195340532","msmarco_passage_28_195364349","msmarco_passage_28_864510112","msmarco_passage_28_864511678","msmarco_passage_28_864512468","msmarco_passage_29_192188512","msmarco_passage_29_653710296","msmarco_passage_30_26840645","msmarco_passage_30_292347848","msmarco_passage_30_500559858","msmarco_passage_30_580579463","msmarco_passage_30_584958974","msmarco_passage_30_630372100","msmarco_passage_30_631942524","msmarco_passage_30_651422467","msmarco_passage_30_705078065","msmarco_passage_30_713529433","msmarco_passage_30_714431951","msmarco_passage_30_717686399","msmarco_passage_30_720287144","msmarco_passage_30_741466243","msmarco_passage_30_744095419","msmarco_passage_30_753936490","msmarco_passage_30_780045514","msmarco_passage_30_791791284","msmarco_passage_30_796116110","msmarco_passage_31_564297888","msmarco_passage_31_577003900","msmarco_passage_31_589548261","msmarco_passage_31_589606197","msmarco_passage_31_591385965","msmarco_passage_31_593528634","msmarco_passage_31_594864752","msmarco_passage_31_602266456","msmarco_passage_31_608727495","msmarco_passage_31_608790513","msmarco_passage_31_613289509","msmarco_passage_31_622390947","msmarco_passage_31_622437912","msmarco_passage_32_244421558","msmarco_passage_32_480896709","msmarco_passage_32_584547635","msmarco_passage_35_174658196","msmarco_passage_36_267969153","msmarco_passage_36_444945944","msmarco_passage_37_769879200","msmarco_passage_37_769927418","msmarco_passage_39_313187575","msmarco_passage_40_510111126","msmarco_passage_43_811249675","msmarco_passage_44_481556946","msmarco_passage_44_586545035","msmarco_passage_44_587206698","msmarco_passage_45_264585643","msmarco_passage_45_349456027",

The primary benefit of a single European currency was increased economic integration and cooperation among EU countries. By eliminating exchange rate fluctuations and transaction costs associated with foreign currency transactions, the euro facilitated trade, investment, and economic growth within the EU.\n\nThe elimination of exchange rate volatility allowed businesses to operate more efficiently, as they no longer had to worry about converting currencies or incurring exchange rate risks. This increased predictability and stability, making it easier for companies to invest and expand across borders. Additionally, a single currency reduced transaction costs associated with exchanging currencies, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nFurthermore, the euro enabled economic integration by reducing transaction costs and increasing trade volumes among EU countries. With a common currency, businesses could operate more easily within the EU market, creating new opportunities for growth and expansion. Overall, the introduction of the euro solidified Europe's position as a major global economic player and promoted greater economic cooperation and stability among its member states.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_725525738","msmarco_passage_01_842747026","msmarco_passage_01_842750925","msmarco_passage_01_842751459","msmarco_passage_06_221671486","msmarco_passage_06_221679898","msmarco_passage_06_221681386","msmarco_passage_06_262765092","msmarco_passage_07_350033830","msmarco_passage_07_350295776","msmarco_passage_07_360671690","msmarco_passage_07_362111370","msmarco_passage_17_138681392","msmarco_passage_17_138684433","msmarco_passage_18_766353021","msmarco_passage_18_766422716","msmarco_passage_18_766588368","msmarco_passage_30_749449565","msmarco_passage_43_536027169","msmarco_passage_45_805410746","msmarco_passage_51_46542865","msmarco_passage_51_47302845","msmarco_passage_51_82702947","msmarco_passage_51_82716347","msmarco_passage_53_63292401","msmarco_passage_54_640975953","msmarco_passage_68_155495476"]}

Launched in 1951, RFE was one of several US-funded broadcasting services established to counter Soviet propaganda and provide an alternative voice for the people of Eastern Europe.\n\nOperated by the US Information Agency (USIA), RFE broadcast news, analysis, and cultural programs in multiple languages, including English, German, Polish, Czech, Russian, and others. The broadcasts were designed to promote democratic values, human rights, and individual freedoms, as well as provide information on current events, politics, and economics from a Western perspective.\n\nRFE's content was carefully crafted to appeal to the diverse cultures and interests of the Eastern European audience, including music, literature, and cultural programs that reflected the heritage and traditions of each country. The broadcasts also included interviews with prominent intellectuals, artists, and dissidents who were brave enough to speak out against Soviet rule.\n\nThrough RFE, the US government aimed to build bridges between East and West, foster democracy and self-determination among Eastern Europeans, and undermine Soviet influence in the region. By providing an alternative voice and source of information, RFE played a significant role in shaping public opinion and promoting democratic change in Eastern Europe during the Cold War era.\n\nDespite its limitations, due to the strict control exerted by the Soviet Union on media outlets, RFE managed to maintain a level of credibility and influence among the people of Eastern Europe. The service was eventually dismantled in 1998, but its legacy continues to inspire advocates for free speech, democracy, and human rights around the world.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_1844673","msmarco_passage_00_4356183","msmarco_passage_02_273729003","msmarco_passage_02_713251743","msmarco_passage_09_775228106","msmarco_passage_11_291134486","msmarco_passage_13_612055334","msmarco_passage_18_435668541","msmarco_passage_18_693300794","msmarco_passage_19_254216961","msmarco_passage_19_26714410","msmarco_passage_19_383843969","msmarco_passage_19_725582677","msmarco_passage_20_469312131","msmarco_passage_20_544493761","msmarco_passage_20_544494898","msmarco_passage_20_544495826","msmarco_passage_20_544497086","msmarco_passage_20_544497546","msmarco_passage_20_544498036","msmarco_passage_20_544498564","msmarco_passage_20_544499012","msmarco_passage_20_544499418","msmarco_passage_20_544499803","msmarco_passage_20_544500170","msmarco_passage_20_544501867","msmarco_passage_20_544502347","msmarco_passage_20_544909032","msmarco_passage_21_511890678","msmarco_passage_21_511891094","msmarco_passage_21_559314552","msmarco_passage_26_865036706","msmarco_passage_27_756795461","msmarco_passage_30_286229076","msmarco_passage_31_31198947","msmarco_passage_31_859330905","msmarco_passage_36_323953668","msmarco_passage_39_18553025","msmarco_passage_39_21614560","msmarco_passage_39_21616069","msmarco_passage_39_21616560","msmarco_passage_39_21617081","msmarco_passage_40_167978653","msmarco_passage_40_167979031","msmarco_passage_40_167979346","msmarco_passage_40_167979702","msmarco_passage_40_167980252","msmarco_passage_40_167980744","msmarco_passage_40_91386164","msmarco_passage_41_591559901","msmarco_passage_45_848744528","msmarco_passage_49_202431613","msmarco_passage_55_802156398","msmarco_passage_65_235879265","msmarco_passage_65_561197663","msmarco_passage_66_592985061","msmarco_passage_67_820255716","msmarco_passage_67_820258878"]}

Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) is the primary law concerned with ensuring the safety and health conditions in the majority of private-sector industries. Enacted in 1970, OSHA sets national standards for workplace safety and health, and its goal is to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all workers. The law requires employers to comply with regulations related to hazard identification, risk assessment, and control measures to prevent injuries and illnesses in the workplace.\n\nUnder OSHA, employers are responsible for maintaining a safe working condition, including providing personal protective equipment (PPE), training employees on safety procedures, and conducting regular inspections to identify potential hazards. Workers have the right to report hazardous conditions and participate in the process of addressing them.

or transverse tubules, play a crucial role in the functioning of muscle cells, particularly in skeletal and cardiac muscles. These specialized structures are invaginations of the plasma membrane that penetrate deep into the muscle cell, connecting it to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).\n\nThe primary function of T-tubules is to facilitate rapid communication between the cytosol of the muscle fiber and the SR. When an action potential reaches the surface of a muscle fiber, it travels down the T-tube towards the myofibril, where the actin-myosin contractile units are located. This allows the muscle fiber to rapidly depolarize and generate a strong contraction.\n\nT-tubules also serve as specialized \"antennae\" that detect changes in calcium concentrations within the cell. When the action potential reaches the T-tube, it triggers the release of calcium ions from the SR into the cytosol through a process called \"calcium-induced calcium release.\" This increase in calcium concentration is then transmitted to the actin-myosin contractile units, allowing for rapid contraction and relaxation of the muscle fiber.\n\nIn addition to facilitating calcium transmission, T-tubules also play a role in regulating the force-generating capacity of the muscle. By controlling the amount of calcium released from the SR, T-tubules help to modulate the strength of the contraction. This is particularly important in cardiac muscles, where rapid and precise control over contractility is essential for maintaining proper heart function.\n\nIn summary, T-tubules are critical structures that enable rapid communication between the cytosol and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the transmission of action potentials and calcium ions that drive muscle contraction. Their unique properties make them an essential component of muscle physiology, allowing for precise control over muscle force production and

The term is derived from the days of rail travel when bandwagons were used to transport goods and people behind a moving train. When a traveler wanted to catch up with another group, they would jump onto the bandwagon, allowing them to ride alongside it.\n\nIn modern usage, the phrase suggests that someone is eager to associate themselves with something that is already gaining momentum or attention. This can be anything from a popular new product to a trendy fashion style, a current event, or even a social cause. By \"jumping on the bandwagon,\" an individual is signaling their willingness to conform to the prevailing attitudes or tastes of the moment.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that jumping on a bandwagon without proper consideration can sometimes be seen as superficial or lacking in genuine commitment. In this context, the phrase cautions against blindly following the crowd without evaluating the merits or value of what one is getting on board with.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_179094483","msmarco_passage_01_254295856","msmarco_passage_01_692918966","msmarco_passage_01_692920285","msmarco_passage_01_692922353","msmarco_passage_01_692922832","msmarco_passage_01_692923205","msmarco_passage_04_181794401","msmarco_passage_04_181795147","msmarco_passage_05_563782946","msmarco_passage_05_563788516","msmarco_passage_05_563789830","msmarco_passage_06_302244060","msmarco_passage_07_728568872","msmarco_passage_11_337162553","msmarco_passage_12_181442295","msmarco_passage_15_589207074","msmarco_passage_22_13899104","msmarco_passage_22_13900633","msmarco_passage_22_234795179","msmarco_passage_22_234860035","msmarco_passage_22_234925232","msmarco_passage_22_88487252","msmarco_passage_22_88489516","msmarco_passage_25_376869589","msmarco_passage_25_376870905","msmarco_passage_25_376872968","msmarco_passage_25_376873446","msmarco_passage_25_376873818","msmarco_passage_25_390046737","msmarco_passage_25_390047493","msmarco_passage_26_809267999","msmarco_passage_29_357169912","msmarco_passage_29_617232841","msmarco_passage_30_131168603","msmarco_passage_30_131171717","msmarco_passage_30_131172954","msmarco_passage_30_131173629","msmarco_passage_30_131174111","msmarco_passage_30_131174746","msmarco_passage_30_131180116","msmarco_passage_30_131200137","msmarco_passage_30_131204210","msmarco_passage_30_132524879","msmarco_passage_30_169971847","msmarco_passage_30_169975126","msmarco_passage_30_291760921","msmarco_passage_32_430967555","msmarco_passage_32_463380331","msmarco_passage_34_545198580","msmarco_passage_42_771809184","msmarco_passage_43_325713868","msmarco_passage_43_325714343","msmarco_passage_43_325718377","msmarco_passage_43_384375014","msmarco_passage_43_384380584","msmarco_passage_43_384381898","msmarco_passage_43_384382367","msmarco_passage_45_771413389","msmarco_passage_47_543221704","msmarco_passage_47_543222397","msmarco_passage_47_543222625","msmarco_passage_50_485038877","msmarco_passage_50_831341103","msmarco_passage_51_67733856","msmarco_passage_51_67734635","msmarco_passage_51_67736234","msmarco_passage_52_224642532","msmarco_passage_53_783821943","msmarco_passage_57_717166832","msmarco_passage_57_75277978","msmarco_passage_57_75278303","msmarco_passage_58_43442942","msmarco_passage_61_796715358","msmarco_passage_61_839109552","msmarco_passage_63_102153304","msmarco_passage_63_102156257","msmarco_passage_64_447858038","msmarco_passage_68_634854557","msmarco_passage_69_47594656"]}

The term \"prior restraint\" refers to the notion of constraining someone's freedom ofExpression before they have even uttered a word, rather than after they have spoken.\n\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court has long recognized prior restraint as a form of censorship that can be unconstitutional under certain circumstances. Prior restraint is considered particularly problematic because it interferes with an individual's First Amendment right to free speech and expression without providing any opportunity for them to express themselves.\n\nPrior restraints can take many forms, including orders from government officials to stop publishing or distributing certain materials, warnings or prohibitions on speaking out about particular topics, or even direct physical suppression of voices. In the past, prior restraint has been used to silence dissenting voices and suppress unpopular ideas.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a growing recognition that prior restraint can be an effective tool for preventing harm, such as in cases where speech poses a clear and present danger to public safety or national security. Nevertheless, the use of prior restraint remains a contentious issue, with many advocates arguing that it should only be used in very narrow circumstances and subject to strict judicial review.\n\nIn general, prior restraint is seen as a more severe form of censorship than post-hoc self-censorship, where an individual voluntarily constricts their own expression out of fear or caution. The debate surrounding prior restraint continues to evolve, with many questions remaining about the balance between protecting public safety and preserving First Amendment rights.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_580968207","msmarco_passage_01_758487571","msmarco_passage_01_758491694","msmarco_passage_01_758493061","msmarco_passage_01_791701828","msmarco_passage_02_20534481","msmarco_passage_02_24687249","msmarco_passage_02_24688154","msmarco_passage_02_24689891","msmarco_passage_09_618972452","msmarco_passage_10_696317784","msmarco_passage_14_109599007","msmarco_passage_14_109600230","msmarco_passage_15_407171828","msmarco_passage_15_407174115","msmarco_passage_15_407177357","msmarco_passage_16_95653147","msmarco_passage_20_487340352","msmarco_passage_20_487342363","msmarco_passage_20_487346340","msmarco_passage_20_487346722","msmarco_passage_20_487348874","msmarco_passage_26_562467771","msmarco_passage_26_565472697","msmarco_passage_26_565474089","msmarco_passage_26_565835758","msmarco_passage_26_565836663","msmarco_passage_26_565838400","msmarco_passage_26_616291499","msmarco_passage_28_207312509","msmarco_passage_28_207312971","msmarco_passage_28_207313787","msmarco_passage_28_207314361","msmarco_passage_28_208105259","msmarco_passage_28_209125286","msmarco_passage_28_54765497","msmarco_passage_30_632425496","msmarco_passage_30_634515556","msmarco_passage_30_679851780","msmarco_passage_30_685763627","msmarco_passage_30_685767821","msmarco_passage_31_544615024","msmarco_passage_33_122464696","msmarco_passage_33_122466742","msmarco_passage_33_122468689","msmarco_passage_33_122469093","msmarco_passage_33_122469933","msmarco_passage_33_122470411","msmarco_passage_33_562932088","msmarco_passage_40_856226045","msmarco_passage_41_660382296","msmarco_passage_51_687838829","msmarco_passage_52_103224724","msmarco_passage_52_103225762","msmarco_passage_52_115066891","msmarco_passage_52_91347567","msmarco_passage_53_804037231","msmarco_passage_54_583145265","msmarco_passage_61_260645694","msmarco_passage_61_648929118","msmarco_passage_61_672280396","msmarco_passage_61_672284759","msmarco_passage_64_194925638","msmarco_passage_64_194926047","msmarco_passage_64_194926716","msmarco_passage_64_194927232","msmarco_passage_64_194927745","msmarco_passage_64_194928598","msmarco_passage_64_212079834"]}

and strong nails are a result of a combination of good nail care habits, a balanced diet, and proper nail growth conditions. To promote healthy nail growth, several factors come into play.\n\nFirstly, keeping your nails hydrated is essential. Applying a moisturizing cuticle oil or nail cream regularly can help lock in moisture and prevent dryness, cracking, and brittleness. This will also reduce the risk of fungal infections such as onychomycosis, which can slow down nail growth.\n\nNext, maintaining good hygiene practices is vital for promoting healthy nail growth. Washing your hands frequently with soap and water can help prevent dirt, bacteria, and other microorganisms from accumulating under the nails, where they can cause infection or damage. Disinfecting your tools and surfaces regularly will also help prevent the spread of fungal infections.\n\nA well-balanced diet rich in essential nutrients is also crucial for promoting healthy nail growth. Foods that are high in biotin, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids are particularly beneficial for nail health. Biotin is a B-complex vitamin that plays a key role in hair, skin, and nail growth, while vitamin E helps to protect the nails from damage and promote collagen production.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids, found in fish and other seafood, help to nourish the nail bed and promote healthy cell growth. Additionally, foods rich in protein such as chicken, beef, and fish can help to build strong nails by providing the necessary amino acids for nail health.\n\nFinally, getting enough sleep is essential for promoting healthy nail growth. During sleep, your body repairs and regenerates tissues, including those under the nails. Lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, stress, and a range of other health problems that can slow down nail growth.\n\nIn addition to these factors, there are some specific nutrients that have been shown to promote healthy nail growth. These include:\n\n* Vitamin C: Helps to stimulate collagen production and improve nail strength\n* Vitamin A: Promotes cell growth and differentiation, helping to repair damaged nails\n* Omega-6 fatty

to Karl Marx, the traditional notion of human nature as an inherently good or neutral entity is a product of bourgeois ideology and capitalist society. In his work \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1848\", Marx argues that the concept of human nature is shaped by the social and economic conditions under which individuals live.\n\nFor Marx, human beings are not born with an innate capacity for self-interest or individualism, but rather these traits are historically and culturally constructed. Under capitalism, the pursuit of personal profit and accumulation of wealth becomes the dominant drive, leading to alienation and the dehumanization of workers. This, in turn, distorts individuals' understanding of themselves as social beings, reducing them to mere commodities.\n\nMarx posits that human beings have a natural inclination towards cooperation, mutual aid, and collective ownership, which is suppressed by the capitalist system's emphasis on competition and private property. He argues that this inherent social nature would be expressed if people were free from the constraints of capitalism, where they could engage in genuine self-activity without being driven solely by economic necessity.\n\nIn his later work, \"Das Kapital\", Marx suggests that a new human society based on socialism can emerge when individuals are able to break free from the capitalist mode of production and its corresponding system of values. In this hypothetical socialist world, people will be free to develop their own interests and capacities, prioritizing collective well-being over individual gain.\n\nMarx's critique of traditional notions of human nature emphasizes that our understanding of ourselves is shaped by our social and economic context. He argues that a radical transformation of society is necessary to reveal the full potential and dignity of humanity, rather than perpetuating the alienating effects of capitalist

woodwind quintet is a rare and unique ensemble that consists of five wind instruments. The typical configuration for a woodwind quintet includes:\n\n1. Flute: Representing the lightest and most agile voice among the woodwinds, the flute provides a soaring and vibrant presence to the ensemble.\n2. Oboe: With its distinctive mellow timbre and mournful sound, the oboe brings a sense of pathos and introspection to the quintet's overall texture.\n3. Clarinet: The clarinet's bright, warm tone and agile agility make it an ideal instrument for adding rhythmic drive and melodic interest to the ensemble.\n4. Bassoon: As the largest and lowest-pitched member of the quintet, the bassoon provides a rich, sonorous foundation that underscores the other instruments' lines.\n5. Cor anglais (also known as English horn): With its warm, mellow sound and subtle vibrato, the cor anglais completes the woodwind quintet's unique sonic palette, adding a sense of depth and nuance to the ensemble's overall sound.\n\nTogether, these five instruments create a rich tapestry of sound that showcases their individual strengths while also highlighting their ability to work together in

While it's not a primary intention of the medication, changes in dosage or individual responses to the treatment may lead to weight fluctuations.\n\nIn general, levothyroxine is more likely to cause weight loss rather than weight gain. This occurs because the hormone helps regulate metabolism and energy levels in the body. When the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones (as in hypothyroidism), it can slow down metabolic rate, leading to slower weight gain or even weight loss.\n\nOnce levothyroxine is started, if the dosage is correct, most people experience an increase in their basal metabolic rate, which can lead to weight loss. Additionally, improved energy levels and enhanced physical performance may also contribute to losing excess body fat.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that individual responses can vary greatly. Some people taking levothyroxine might not lose weight at all or even gain a small amount, especially if they have certain health conditions such as obesity, which can make weight loss more challenging.\n\nMaintaining an optimal dosage under the guidance of a healthcare provider is crucial for minimizing potential side effects and maximizing the benefits of the medication.

the context of accounting, \"building improvements\" refer to the non-depreciable assets or expenditures made on a property after its initial construction. These improvements are considered non-cash items and do not result in an expected reduction in the asset's useful life.\n\nBuilding improvements include upgrades, renovations, additions, or expansions that enhance the existing building or structure. Examples of building improvements might include installing new electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC units, or architectural features such as flooring, walls, or ceilings. They may also involve the installation of new fixtures, appliances, or equipment, such as elevators, escalators, or security systems.\n\nThe accounting treatment for building improvements depends on whether they are capital expenditures (CapEx) or operating expenditures (OpEx). If a building improvement is expected to increase the property's value, extend its useful life, or improve its efficiency, it is typically recorded as a CapEx asset. This means that the cost of the improvement is capitalized and recognized as an asset on the balance sheet.\n\nOn the other hand, if a building improvement is expected to be used up within one year or its first year of use, it may be treated as an OpEx expense. In this case, the cost of the improvement would be deducted in the period incurred as an operating expense.\n\nThe financial accounting standards related to building improvements are outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" which provides guidance on the asset recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements for building improvements.
