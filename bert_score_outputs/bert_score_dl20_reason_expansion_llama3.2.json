However, the exact mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood.\n\nIn general, a low-grade fever (less than 101.5\u00b0F) during early pregnancy is unlikely to cause miscarriage. In fact, some studies have found that women experiencing mild fevers without other underlying conditions tend to have normal pregnancy outcomes.\n\nIt's essential to note that fever in early pregnancy can be caused by various factors, such as viral infections, hormonal changes, or even medication use. The impact of fever on pregnancy outcome depends on the severity and duration of the fever, as well as the presence of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nIn summary, while fever during early pregnancy may increase the risk of miscarriage, the evidence is not conclusive, and individual outcomes can vary widely.

The Etruscan civilization is characterized by its impressive architectural achievements, such as the temples at Tarquinia and Volterra, its sophisticated art, including frescoes and metalwork, and its extensive trade networks.\n\nDespite their significant contributions to Roman culture and politics, much about the Etruscans remains enigmatic, leaving room for ongoing scholarly debate and speculation about their origins, language, and cultural practices.","dids":["1219224","1219231","1278930","1448528","1460907","1648244","1984785","2132420","2226645","2226651","2474195","2550806","2550807","2550811","2550813","2550814","259432","259433","2626098","2626099","2626106","2631821","2631823","2631826","2631827","2780358","2780360","2780362","2839813","3029510","3092263","3219396","3256060","3315743","3818498","3954469","4494818","451169","451170","451172","451174","451175","451176","451178","4878253","5105078","517906","5237907","5237909","5289635","5327045","5713962","5809828","5809832","5809833","5881042","5881046","5930982","5930987","6223547","6289799","6580478","6580480","6580481","6580482","7242773","8201175","8260194","8301993"]}

Muscles are comprised of skeletal muscle fibers surrounded by a layer of connective tissue, which allows for contraction and relaxation. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on the bone to which it is attached, resulting in a change in joint angle.\n\nThe relationship between muscles and bones is governed by the principles of mechanics, where forces applied to one part of the body can be transmitted to another through joints. Joints are synovial cavities that allow for limited movement between two or more bones. As a muscle contracts, it pulls on the bone at the joint, causing a change in joint angle and allowing for movement.\n\nThe lever system plays a crucial role in facilitating movement by distributing forces across joints. Bones can be classified as either long bones (e.g., femur), short bones (e.g., carpals), or sesamoid bones (e.g., patella). The orientation of these bones in relation to each other and the direction of muscle pull determine the mechanical advantage gained from contraction.\n\nAs muscles contract, they rotate joints around three planes: flexion\/extension, abduction\/adduction, and rotation. This combination of movements allows for a wide range of motion in various directions. For example, when the biceps muscle contracts, it pulls on the humerus bone at the elbow joint, allowing for flexion of the arm.\n\nIn summary, the interplay between muscles and bones enables movement by converting chemical energy into mechanical energy, leveraging the principles of mechanics to distribute forces across joints, and facilitating a range of motion through coordinated contraction of multiple muscles.","dids":["1157249","2686304","3500851","3500858","4718251","6007469","6319711","6486090","6638749","8319987","8319992","8319993","885784"]}

Narcotics are typically defined as substances that have analgesic (pain-relieving), sedative, or intoxicating properties, which caffeine does not exhibit. Instead, caffeine is classified as a xanthine alkaloid stimulant, activating adenosine receptors in the brain and increasing dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin levels to produce its stimulatory effects. While caffeine can have some mild analgesic properties, its primary mechanism of action is as a central nervous system stimulant, not as a narcotic.","dids":["1057276","1352544","1352545","1352547","1352549","1352550","1352551","1352552","1518540","1518541","1518543","154239","1724502","1724503","1724504","1724506","1724507","1724508","2748170","3056677","3150060","3210137","3210138","3236291","3790608","3790610","3790613","3912286","3912288","3912290","3912291","4449599","4607791","4642223","4642231","4788555","4788556","4985018","4985020","5252815","5252816","5252819","5515801","5515803","5515804","558748","558751","558752","558756","5745569","5922366","5922369","6085620","6289819","6289824","6289825","6743548","6743551","6743554","6796411","6796414","6796416","6913938","6913940","6913942","6945009","7002128","7002129","7002130","7002133","7140635","7196947","7222504","7334718","7339772","7474481","7474482","7474484","7474485","7474486","7474487","7622492","7634482","7634486","8068413","8068418","8116653","8116654","8175453","8175458","8204764","8204766","8475254","8504559","8504560","8608603","8611267","978353"]}

Soluble fiber-rich foods such as oats, barley, nuts (especially almonds and walnuts), and seeds (like chia and flax) can help bind to bile acids and remove them from the body, which in turn reduces cholesterol production. Fatty fish like salmon and mackerel are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to lower triglycerides. Avocados are rich in monounsaturated fats that can also contribute to lowered cholesterol. Plant-based protein sources such as legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans), tofu, and tempeh can help reduce LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol. Additionally, healthy fats like olive oil and fatty fruits (like avocados) are good choices for lowering cholesterol levels.","dids":["1008441","1061501","10814","10815","10816","10817","10819","1112927","1158068","1158069","1409667","1447386","1536620","1553537","1710395","1710398","1901474","1919836","1973125","1975068","2161297","2184266","2184271","2184274","2346991","2346999","3320938","338634","3437551","3511702","3818946","3818948","395325","395326","4080244","415497","4200820","4232303","424015","4282328","4346518","4351117","4351120","4553098","4955824","5090232","510462","5252885","5266178","5266181","5577258","5577259","5577263","5577264","582720","582721","5846399","58950","6078228","6188185","6188188","621289","6309262","6434719","6450951","6719375","6723619","684318","684319","684321","684322","688118","688120","688121","6899812","6938329","7179791","718822","7199721","8414352","921778","921779","934201","934203"]}

It is indicated for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart failure, particularly in patients with reduced ejection fraction. Carvedilol also exhibits antioxidant properties, which contribute to its protective effects on the cardiovascular system.\n\nIn addition to its primary uses, carvedilol has been found to be beneficial in reducing mortality and morbidity in certain high-risk populations, such as those with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction (heart attack) or chronic heart failure. Its unique mechanism of action involves both beta-blocking and alpha-1 blocking effects, which help to reduce blood pressure, decrease the workload on the heart, and improve cardiac function.\n\nCarvedilol is also used off-label for the treatment of certain other conditions, including pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland) and coronary artery disease. Its use in these conditions is typically reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other treatments. Overall, carvedilol's unique pharmacological profile has made it a valuable therapeutic option for managing various cardiovascular conditions.","dids":["119352","119354","119355","119358","119359","1379833","1546126","1546127","1546128","1546131","1546134","1675561","1675562","1675564","2038708","2080305","2080307","2080311","2080312","2267048","2267050","2267051","2267052","2267054","2672427","3325050","3363613","3466607","3466610","5623834","5623835","6286919","6286920","6286922","6286923","6286925","6578660","6654304","7450717","7450718","7450719","7450725","7465955","7473713","7491697","7491698","7491699","7491700","7491704","7706119","7706120","7744346","7744347","7744348","7744349","7744350","7744351","8144448","8144451","8326077","8326078","8395840","914661","914662","914666","914668","914669"]}

This can be caused by Graves' disease, a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, leading to an overproduction of thyroid hormones.\n\nIn some cases, an elevated TSH level is also associated with certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, pituitary tumors, or adrenal disorders. However, a low TSH level typically indicates that the thyroid gland is producing too much thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which can cause symptoms like rapid heartbeat, palpitations, and anxiety.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, as a low TSH level can also be associated with rare conditions or medications. The normal range for TSH levels varies between laboratories, so it's crucial to follow up with your doctor and get individualized guidance on interpretation and management of your results.","dids":["1004231","1034851","1126450","1186733","1204542","1226405","1227863","1304074","1307361","1398131","1518725","1754997","1854588","1854589","1957247","1957252","2060868","208375","208378","2096762","2096763","2096764","2121023","2146065","215342","218503","2195505","2216803","2267182","2701130","2778108","2808569","2808576","2989520","3026712","3066749","3229236","3263516","3282142","3367629","3367630","343072","3551380","3554994","3602544","3678130","3682401","3703701","3803120","3851748","3926698","3927852","3973990","3992434","4088606","418508","4261742","430748","4314284","4314290","4359113","4359297","4359298","4450952","4568361","4835720","4955687","4998514","5073872","5161853","5505906","5821902","5827713","5910009","5924242","598202","598204","6146400","6218616","6354341","6354345","6354348","6466454","6497381","6647308","6647309","6702284","6702288","6702955","6730883","6730887","6776100","6835512","6850717","6857991","6914960","6929876","6985038","7000432","7037260","7109035","7109037","7112191","7112192","7275188","7315196","7420930","7880194","7917064","7929765","8097987","8348102","8412229","8462353","8471417","8628509","877566","894100","914682","914685","944945"]}

He designed a pendulum clock that used a swinging pendulum to regulate its movement, which significantly improved its accuracy. Over time, other scientists and inventors contributed to the development of more accurate chronometers, including English physicist Robert Hooke and French mathematician Joseph-Michel Jaques.\n\nThe modern chronometer is based on the concept of mechanical timekeeping, where a series of gears and springs work together to measure time with high precision. Today, chronometers are used in various fields, such as astronomy, navigation, and scientific research, to ensure accurate measurements of time.","dids":["2666444","4118696","4118698","4605022","5452882","8276218","8276221","8276225","8577877","8577878"]}

Overall, the complex structure of bronchioles involves multiple tissue layers working together to facilitate airflow and gas exchange in the lungs.","dids":["1027218","1183903","1183904","1194685","1545740","1702011","1835661","2001626","2001628","2020133","2631739","2631741","2631743","2631744","2631746","2631747","2910887","2989234","2989236","3057739","3152169","3152176","3170857","3535611","3763841","4768595","4854255","5039693","5039695","5177082","534956","5380650","5439629","5681257","5681258","5681262","5730352","5730355","5730356","5730357","5730358","5747079","5890301","5890304","5890307","5890308","6006655","6042348","6042350","6071696","6071697","6104494","6282189","6818272","6818273","7040507","7798475","7798480","7848930","7970846","8345544","8563840","8689503","8772516","8772517","8772519","8772520","8772521","8772525"]}

The term \"rock and roll\" itself gained popularity around 1948-1949, with Bill Haley and his Comets' song \"Rock Around the Clock\" often credited as a key milestone. However, it was the late 1950s, particularly in the United States, that saw the emergence of rock and roll as a distinct genre, with artists like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley popularizing its fusion of styles.","dids":["1335718","2404877","2814756","2826200","3814285","3899965","4086990","4377478","4489259","4489266","4696636","4696642","4800890","5270014","5300647","5300651","5300654","5831703","5831707","5831708","5831711","6298951","6782541","6782543","6938106","7282174","7282176","7290071","7290072","8219044","8219249","8269673","8269679","8269680","8772071","8772073"]}

However, the events leading up to the assassination involved a network of Bolshevik officials and sympathizers, including Grigory Rasputin's assassin, Vladimir Purishkevich, and other conspirators.\n\nThe true extent of complicity among various individuals remains disputed, with some arguing that it was a collective effort by multiple factions within the Soviet government. Nevertheless, Yakov Yurovsky's firing squad in the basement of the Ipatiev House remains the definitive scene of the family's brutal murder.","dids":["127930","1356426","1637694","1637695","1845636","2443319","2443321","2664986","2664990","2664993","2664995","3374866","3378240","3878603","3878608","4355523","4541688","4994428","5058738","650641","650642","7022079","7137848","7137851","8696952","8696953","8696954","8696956","8696960","8696961"]}

For example, a tighter pattern choke is often used at closer ranges to ensure accurate hits on smaller game, while a looser pattern choke is better suited for longer shots and larger game.\n\nThe angle and size of the choke are determined by factors such as barrel length, shotshell type, and the desired level of spread.

For heavily soiled garments, try soaking them in a solution of equal parts hydrogen peroxide and water before washing.\n\nFor delicate fabrics like wool or silk, use a gentle whitening method like sunlight exposure or a mild detergent specifically designed for these materials.\n\nWhen using chemical-based solutions like bleach, always follow the instructions carefully and test a small area first to ensure safety. Consider alternative options like OxiClean or Shout, which can be more effective while minimizing risks.\n\nRegular maintenance, such as washing clothes in cold water and avoiding over-drying, can also help maintain their whiteness.","dids":["1294050","1421349","1421350","1421351","1421352","1421353","1421354","1421355","1421358","1457501","1643324","1649633","1649635","1649636","1649639","1649640","1649642","2141333","2589356","2589358","2589362","2745683","2903084","3023371","3102788","3102792","3381621","370201","3719558","3909388","3909933","3941207","3941209","4572520","5066712","5330512","5830553","5878614","5878616","5878620","6048405","6169875","6254865","6254867","6254871","6254874","6450417","6522183","6635998","6636001","6731792","6756165","6916357","7341607","7545003","7654965","7654968","7996105","8175408","8175409","8175410","8175411","8175412","8175414","8258085","8289552","8289554","8289556","8289557","8289558","8289559","8289561","8410352","8410357","8591633","865539"]}

Chaff refers to a mixture of dry plant material such as wheat, oats, or other grains, often mixed with plastic or other materials, designed to resemble natural debris. The primary function of chaff is to confuse radar systems, making it difficult for them to distinguish between actual targets and harmless noise.\n\nFlare, on the other hand, refers to a type of pyrotechnic device used to create a burst of smoke and light in the atmosphere, typically at high altitudes. Flares are often used by military personnel as a signaling device or to mark the location of dropped supplies, and they can also be used to confuse enemy radar systems. The key distinction between chaff and flare lies in their composition, purpose, and deployment altitude \u2013 chaff is usually low-altitude, while flares occur at much higher altitudes.\n\nHistorically, both chaff and flares have been used for decades to counter the effectiveness of radar systems during World War II and the Cold War. In modern times, they continue to be employed in various military and civilian contexts, such as crop management and civil aviation.","dids":["5769768","8111879","8111886"]}

This occurs when there is a gap or break in the rock record, where sedimentary rocks or other units are deposited without being directly overlain by younger strata. Nonconformities can provide valuable information about the Earth's past, such as changes in sea level, climate, and tectonic activity.\n\nNonconformities are typically identified through a combination of field observations, geochemical analysis, and geophysical surveys. They can be further classified into two main types: angular and planar nonconformities. Angular nonconformities exhibit a sharp break between the underlying and overlying rocks, while planar nonconformities show a gradual transition.\n\nDifferentiating nonconformities from other geological features, such as unconformities (which represent normal faulting or erosion) and disconformities (which indicate sudden changes in rock facies), is crucial for accurate interpretation of the geological record. By understanding nonconformities, geologists can reconstruct the Earth's history and provide insights into the processes that shaped our planet over time.","dids":["283267","3588234","5752652","684558","8100542","8100545"]}

For example, `#!\/bin\/bash` instructs the operating system to use the Bash shell when running the script. This allows the script to specify its own execution environment and ensures compatibility across different systems.\n\nInterpretive syntax variations exist for other programming languages, such as Python (`#!\/usr\/bin\/env python`) and Perl (`#!\/usr\/bin\/perl`).

These macrophages release various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit additional immune cells, including neutrophils and lymphocytes, to the affected area. As the inflammatory response intensifies, a shift towards an anti-inflammatory phase occurs, characterized by the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10.\n\nConcurrently, fibroblasts are mobilized from the surrounding tissue to the wound site, where they become activated to proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts then produce a rich network of collagen fibers, initiating the process of wound stabilization and granulation tissue formation. Furthermore, growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) play crucial roles in regulating cellular behavior, promoting angiogenesis, and modulating the extracellular matrix composition.\n\nThroughout this complex interplay, various molecular signals, including those mediated by the Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway, BMP signaling, and Notch signaling, contribute to the coordinated regulation of granulation tissue formation. While the exact mechanisms of initiation remain somewhat ambiguous, it is clear that granulation tissue development involves a multifaceted interplay between immune cells, fibroblasts, and growth factors.","dids":["1200778","1659308","1817052","1817055","3321778","4057637","4057642","4274863","4274865","4668677","4931641","4931642","6600375","733203","733208","8220878","8379135"]}

A hotel typically features a lobby, reception area, and multiple floors with interior corridors connecting rooms. Guests can access various amenities such as a restaurant, fitness center, and room service.\n\nIn contrast, a motel is designed around individual rooms that open directly onto the parking lot or driveway, eliminating the need for an interior corridor system. Each room usually has its own exterior door, allowing direct access to the outside world. Motels often have fewer on-site amenities compared to hotels but offer more flexibility in terms of check-in and check-out times.\n\nHowever, there is some overlap between the two, as many modern motels blur the lines by incorporating hotel-like features such as indoor pools or restaurants into their design. Despite these similarities, a motel's primary focus remains on providing individual rooms with easy access to parking, whereas a hotel prioritizes comfort and convenience within its interior environment.","dids":["1056534","1634131","1634134","1642217","6464515","6464521","6963072","8728070","8728072","8728074","8728076"]}
