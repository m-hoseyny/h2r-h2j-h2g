In general, landlords may have some responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their tenants if they are aware of potential risks or hazards on the premises.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, landlords are subject to certain duties to maintain a safe living environment for their tenants. This includes taking reasonable steps to secure the property, install working locks and alarms, and provide adequate lighting and ventilation.\n\nHowever, the extent to which landlords must go to prevent break-ins and protect tenants from harm can be unclear. Some courts have held that landlords owe no duty to protect tenants from third-party trespassers, while others have recognized a more limited duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent foreseeable harm.\n\nIn any case, landlords who are aware of potential risks or hazards on the premises, such as unlocked doors or broken windows, may be liable for failing to address these issues. If a tenant is injured as a result of a break-in, they may seek damages from the landlord, but the outcome will depend on the specific circumstances and applicable laws in their jurisdiction.\n\nUltimately, the liability of landlords in these situations will depend on a careful analysis of the facts and the application of relevant laws and regulations.","dids":["msmarco_passage_02_500355930","msmarco_passage_02_500357167","msmarco_passage_02_720119353","msmarco_passage_03_865272429","msmarco_passage_03_865273362","msmarco_passage_03_865273798","msmarco_passage_03_865281718","msmarco_passage_03_865282196","msmarco_passage_03_866751723","msmarco_passage_03_866752656","msmarco_passage_03_866753092","msmarco_passage_03_866761012","msmarco_passage_03_866761490","msmarco_passage_03_866764466","msmarco_passage_03_866765399","msmarco_passage_03_866765835","msmarco_passage_03_866773755","msmarco_passage_03_866774233","msmarco_passage_07_847592319","msmarco_passage_24_751830883","msmarco_passage_24_751833141","msmarco_passage_26_588239530","msmarco_passage_30_113598293","msmarco_passage_37_406975398","msmarco_passage_37_406976329","msmarco_passage_37_406976764","msmarco_passage_37_406984666","msmarco_passage_37_406985143","msmarco_passage_52_117282982","msmarco_passage_52_117286264","msmarco_passage_52_19587834","msmarco_passage_52_296788730","msmarco_passage_53_254998669","msmarco_passage_61_567605094","msmarco_passage_64_515535838","msmarco_passage_65_35603332","msmarco_passage_65_41313356","msmarco_passage_67_908198700"]}

However, according to recent global trends, the average age of first-time marriages for men worldwide has been steadily increasing.\n\nIn general, the average age of men at marriage varies by region and cultural context. For instance, in many Western countries, the average age is around 30-32 years old, while in some African and Asian nations, it can be significantly lower, often ranging from 20 to 25 years old. In contrast, some Eastern European and Latin American countries have seen a rise in marriage ages, with men typically marrying between their mid-to-late 20s.\n\nA recent study by the United Nations estimated that globally, the average age of first-time marriages for men is approximately 28-29 years old, based on data from over 100 countries. However, it's essential to note that these numbers can fluctuate and may not reflect specific regional or cultural contexts.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_358089435","msmarco_passage_01_436571677","msmarco_passage_02_648878058","msmarco_passage_03_220189951","msmarco_passage_03_743205901","msmarco_passage_04_287901958","msmarco_passage_05_363414983","msmarco_passage_07_100117135","msmarco_passage_07_104896351","msmarco_passage_07_282042632","msmarco_passage_07_94355630","msmarco_passage_07_99995512","msmarco_passage_08_380359533","msmarco_passage_08_805249043","msmarco_passage_08_805396147","msmarco_passage_10_30422793","msmarco_passage_11_405307723","msmarco_passage_11_59934964","msmarco_passage_11_59935812","msmarco_passage_13_137193989","msmarco_passage_15_582147759","msmarco_passage_15_619583701","msmarco_passage_16_351379843","msmarco_passage_18_221399667","msmarco_passage_19_71344912","msmarco_passage_19_857745018","msmarco_passage_20_346841834","msmarco_passage_23_864601995","msmarco_passage_25_192291144","msmarco_passage_27_711427689","msmarco_passage_28_600331430","msmarco_passage_28_600332146","msmarco_passage_28_600332496","msmarco_passage_29_109179960","msmarco_passage_29_409688111","msmarco_passage_29_655975423","msmarco_passage_30_590351057","msmarco_passage_30_725337281","msmarco_passage_37_500000413","msmarco_passage_39_147134385","msmarco_passage_39_604156597","msmarco_passage_40_398498150","msmarco_passage_41_263863504","msmarco_passage_41_263916437","msmarco_passage_41_264060755","msmarco_passage_41_719845192","msmarco_passage_43_101809619","msmarco_passage_43_96209725","msmarco_passage_45_264750792","msmarco_passage_47_727213984","msmarco_passage_50_17951343","msmarco_passage_51_55496481","msmarco_passage_51_59949637","msmarco_passage_57_15345234","msmarco_passage_57_18921993","msmarco_passage_57_18942785","msmarco_passage_58_388835310","msmarco_passage_62_613505678","msmarco_passage_63_434339571","msmarco_passage_63_696247141","msmarco_passage_63_696249111","msmarco_passage_66_773193685","msmarco_passage_68_19987965"]}

Patients with crest syndrome often exhibit symptoms of esophageal dysmotility, including dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain, which are attributed to the compromised esophageal peristalsis and impaired coordination between the diaphragm and esophageal muscles.\n\nThe pathophysiology of crested syndrome is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, autoimmune disorders such as celiac disease or rheumatoid arthritis, and muscle weakness leading to diaphragmatic dysfunction. This can result in abnormal esophageal clearance pressures, impaired esophageal motility, and altered gastroesophageal junction function, ultimately contributing to the development of esophageal symptoms.\n\nDifferential diagnosis is crucial, as the clinical presentation of crest syndrome can be non-specific and overlapping with other conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or achalasia. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including imaging studies like endoscopy, barium swallow, or manometry, is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis and manage symptoms effectively.\n\nTreatment for crested syndrome-related esophageal dysfunction typically involves addressing the underlying causes of muscle weakness and diaphragmatic dysfunction, as well as managing symptoms with pharmacological interventions, dietary modifications, and, in some cases, surgical interventions.","dids":["msmarco_passage_02_345652183","msmarco_passage_09_386813526","msmarco_passage_28_272361202","msmarco_passage_28_272372639","msmarco_passage_28_272384076","msmarco_passage_29_522029302","msmarco_passage_33_211410392","msmarco_passage_33_528428380"]}

impact of light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration on photosynthesis rates can vary significantly depending on plant species, environmental conditions, and individual tolerance levels. Both factors play crucial roles in regulating photosynthesis, but their relative influence can differ.\n\nIn general, light intensity is a more critical factor than carbon dioxide concentration for many plants, as excessive CO2 concentrations can lead to photoinhibition, where high light intensities damage photosynthetic pigments. Conversely, insufficient light intensity limits photosynthesis by reducing the energy available for electron transport.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing CO2 concentrations generally stimulate photosynthesis in C3 and C4 plants, but at a certain threshold (typically around 1,000 \u03bcmol\/mol), further increases become less effective due to decreased stomatal opening. This points towards CO2 limit potentially being lower than light intensity for many plant species.\n\nHowever, the optimal balance between these two variables varies widely among different plant species and growth conditions.

Some states offer direct enrollment through the state Medicaid agency.\n\nOnce an application is submitted, it will be reviewed to determine eligibility based on factors like income, family size, and resources. If eligible, the state will process the application and issue an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which can be used to purchase health insurance or pay for medical expenses.\n\nIn some states, Medicaid enrollment may also occur through a state-specific program, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In these cases, families may need to provide additional documentation, like proof of income and residency.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) often provides financial information needed for Medicaid applications. Some states also offer online portals or phone numbers for families to check their application status and track the processing of their Medicaid claims.\n\nAfter receiving approval, the state will issue a Medicaid card with the family's child's name and birthdate.

For refineries and offshore platforms, the Act imposes stringent environmental regulations, requiring them to implement and maintain pollution prevention measures, such as primary containment systems, secondary containment systems, and spill response plans. These regulations often result in increased capital expenditures and operational costs.\n\nFor oil transportation companies, the Act necessitates the construction of double-hull tankers and bulk carriers with a minimum capacity for oil cargo, thereby increasing their investment requirements. Additionally, these companies must adhere to stricter safety standards for crew training and equipment, which can affect their labor costs and competitiveness.\n\nIntegrated oil and gas companies must comply with regulations related to well control, drilling operations, and onshore facilities, including the installation of blowout preventers and emergency response systems. These compliance measures may require significant investments in technology and infrastructure upgrades.\n\nIn general, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 has led to increased operational costs, capital expenditures, and regulatory burdens for oil companies. The industry's transition to more stringent safety and environmental standards has resulted in a shift towards more efficient and sustainable operations, with long-term benefits for both the environment and the companies themselves.","dids":["msmarco_passage_15_789050318","msmarco_passage_17_527700910","msmarco_passage_36_301500994","msmarco_passage_45_441302401","msmarco_passage_45_442414342"]}

Gardner is an American developmental psychologist known for his theory of multiple intelligences. He proposed that individuals have multiple types of intelligence, rather than a single, universal form of intelligence. Gardner identified eight types of intelligence: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic.\n\nGardner's work focuses on understanding how people learn and process information across different domains. He has developed various assessments and frameworks to help identify an individual's strengths and weaknesses in each of the eight intelligences. Gardner's theory has been widely discussed and applied in fields such as education, psychology, and neuroscience.\n\nThroughout his career, Gardner has written extensively on topics related to intelligence, learning, and human development.

berry, also known as five-flavor berries, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. While some studies suggest potential health benefits, the scientific consensus is limited due to conflicting results and a lack of standardization in research. Some reported benefits of schisandra berry include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, as well as potential effects on cardiovascular health and cognitive function. However, more high-quality research is needed to confirm its efficacy and optimal dosing.\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, schisandra berries are believed to promote overall health and longevity, and may help to improve energy levels and mental clarity. They are often consumed as a tea or added to herbal formulas, but the quality of commercial products can vary widely.

Initially, he rejected traditional Christianity, but after a series of personal crises, including an apparent spiritual awakening, he began to incorporate elements of mysticism and spirituality into his philosophy. While Nietzsche never explicitly identified as an atheist, his critiques of traditional morality and faith often led many to interpret him as such. However, his later works, particularly \"The Will to Power\" and \"Ecce Homo,\" suggest a more nuanced view of the role of faith in human existence. Ultimately, Nietzsche's philosophy resists categorization within the bounds of traditional theological or atheistic frameworks, instead embracing a multifaceted and deeply personal understanding of the human condition.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_656327292","msmarco_passage_01_194956100","msmarco_passage_03_851893210","msmarco_passage_04_129428663","msmarco_passage_04_452738297","msmarco_passage_06_584196373","msmarco_passage_06_611737750","msmarco_passage_07_333202102","msmarco_passage_07_639657097","msmarco_passage_07_788722998","msmarco_passage_08_437709469","msmarco_passage_10_691832727","msmarco_passage_11_465542495","msmarco_passage_11_617354223","msmarco_passage_11_617355016","msmarco_passage_11_617358578","msmarco_passage_12_588569088","msmarco_passage_13_345754350","msmarco_passage_13_345755496","msmarco_passage_13_345757682","msmarco_passage_14_194848821","msmarco_passage_17_472065156","msmarco_passage_18_35338301","msmarco_passage_18_560604608","msmarco_passage_18_777446772","msmarco_passage_19_111711518","msmarco_passage_19_111712462","msmarco_passage_19_402992693","msmarco_passage_20_400758643","msmarco_passage_21_300921049","msmarco_passage_23_860736582","msmarco_passage_24_490502655","msmarco_passage_24_649418758","msmarco_passage_25_833258014","msmarco_passage_25_833258318","msmarco_passage_26_732222938","msmarco_passage_29_364916433","msmarco_passage_29_619645741","msmarco_passage_29_631034257","msmarco_passage_29_780746555","msmarco_passage_30_27664975","msmarco_passage_34_93967147","msmarco_passage_36_630182631","msmarco_passage_37_211688063","msmarco_passage_37_363242769","msmarco_passage_37_363296970","msmarco_passage_37_363298332","msmarco_passage_37_822126895","msmarco_passage_38_51045296","msmarco_passage_38_799560881","msmarco_passage_39_497540129","msmarco_passage_40_158087024","msmarco_passage_41_504594752","msmarco_passage_45_199662621","msmarco_passage_47_843974765","msmarco_passage_47_843976241","msmarco_passage_47_843978047","msmarco_passage_51_425263822","msmarco_passage_51_425264307","msmarco_passage_51_425265232","msmarco_passage_51_425269073","msmarco_passage_55_153268398","msmarco_passage_55_602655827","msmarco_passage_57_49061407","msmarco_passage_57_50035708","msmarco_passage_58_39423436","msmarco_passage_58_670545493","msmarco_passage_61_256896606","msmarco_passage_62_104556715","msmarco_passage_62_568154858","msmarco_passage_62_568342936","msmarco_passage_63_34605095","msmarco_passage_63_34611889","msmarco_passage_64_373471586","msmarco_passage_64_373472118","msmarco_passage_68_38020681"]}

you have asthma, it's essential to be mindful of certain foods that can trigger or exacerbate symptoms. While food allergies can cause severe reactions, some foods may also trigger asthma symptoms due to their inherent properties, such as spiciness, acidity, or high histamine levels. Avoiding the following foods may help alleviate asthma symptoms:\n\n* Spicy or sharp-tinged foods like chili peppers, wasabi, and horseradish\n* Citrus fruits and juices, especially orange, lemon, and grapefruit\n* Tomatoes, tomato sauce, and processed meats containing tomatoes\n* Fermented foods high in histamine, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and some types of cheese\n* Processed meats like hot dogs, sausages, and bacon\n* Dairy products from cows that produce a high amount of lactose, leading to inflammation\n* Foods with sulfites, often found in processed foods, wine, and beer\n\nIt's crucial to note that everyone's response to food triggers can be different, and what works for one person may not work for another. If you have asthma, consult with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to determine the best approach for managing your symptoms through dietary changes.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_226159488","msmarco_passage_01_471731652","msmarco_passage_02_258062627","msmarco_passage_04_522262527","msmarco_passage_05_830588101","msmarco_passage_06_414689293","msmarco_passage_06_752786402","msmarco_passage_07_459640004","msmarco_passage_07_459640819","msmarco_passage_07_592492956","msmarco_passage_07_691671039","msmarco_passage_07_691673119","msmarco_passage_07_704394253","msmarco_passage_07_704395144","msmarco_passage_08_95584857","msmarco_passage_09_269093780","msmarco_passage_09_270325536","msmarco_passage_09_270335993","msmarco_passage_09_272968400","msmarco_passage_09_274647485","msmarco_passage_09_274656480","msmarco_passage_09_275621628","msmarco_passage_09_277611327","msmarco_passage_09_279810682","msmarco_passage_09_279819894","msmarco_passage_09_282561795","msmarco_passage_09_285028468","msmarco_passage_13_707907453","msmarco_passage_15_804758947","msmarco_passage_15_806662419","msmarco_passage_15_808075727","msmarco_passage_15_808311968","msmarco_passage_15_808312333","msmarco_passage_15_808518131","msmarco_passage_15_810455013","msmarco_passage_15_811343786","msmarco_passage_15_812262307","msmarco_passage_15_813007604","msmarco_passage_15_813447711","msmarco_passage_15_814101614","msmarco_passage_15_814574660","msmarco_passage_15_815317155","msmarco_passage_15_816494547","msmarco_passage_15_817022523","msmarco_passage_15_817921732","msmarco_passage_21_60121737","msmarco_passage_21_60130083","msmarco_passage_23_439659441","msmarco_passage_23_439972669","msmarco_passage_24_192912201","msmarco_passage_24_201257738","msmarco_passage_24_247762454","msmarco_passage_24_267590472","msmarco_passage_28_256277717","msmarco_passage_28_801153727","msmarco_passage_31_496282715","msmarco_passage_34_388986571","msmarco_passage_34_556478754","msmarco_passage_44_284217718","msmarco_passage_44_315409908","msmarco_passage_44_382776129","msmarco_passage_44_382799923","msmarco_passage_44_383684161","msmarco_passage_44_384090364","msmarco_passage_44_384092547","msmarco_passage_44_386592301","msmarco_passage_44_386822702","msmarco_passage_44_389592219","msmarco_passage_44_390960734","msmarco_passage_44_392792931","msmarco_passage_44_394467527","msmarco_passage_44_400243002","msmarco_passage_44_400249526","msmarco_passage_44_401562715","msmarco_passage_44_404319882","msmarco_passage_44_405455212","msmarco_passage_44_405659530","msmarco_passage_44_405888108","msmarco_passage_44_407719333","msmarco_passage_44_407900202","msmarco_passage_44_408019432","msmarco_passage_44_410914892","msmarco_passage_44_411006641","msmarco_passage_44_411183954","msmarco_passage_44_411940087","msmarco_passage_44_412211002","msmarco_passage_44_413553010","msmarco_passage_44_415139204","msmarco_passage_44_415259503","msmarco_passage_44_415403346","msmarco_passage_44_416504705","msmarco_passage_44_416513705","msmarco_passage_44_417462912","msmarco_passage_44_418555733","msmarco_passage_44_420780034","msmarco_passage_44_420782653","msmarco_passage_44_421803201","msmarco_passage_44_422629973","msmarco_passage_44_424759555","msmarco_passage_44_427529113","msmarco_passage_44_428867418","msmarco_passage_44_428891954","msmarco_passage_44_445605493","msmarco_passage_47_715842873","msmarco_passage_48_629237295","msmarco_passage_48_633752299","msmarco_passage_48_633755019","msmarco_passage_48_664678588","msmarco_passage_48_668137775","msmarco_passage_49_36627133","msmarco_passage_52_176697973","msmarco_passage_52_204535809","msmarco_passage_53_612079244","msmarco_passage_54_106325319","msmarco_passage_55_830920460","msmarco_passage_55_830929742","msmarco_passage_57_22949602","msmarco_passage_58_852061348","msmarco_passage_59_517358782","msmarco_passage_59_518015723","msmarco_passage_59_518194542","msmarco_passage_59_520041458","msmarco_passage_59_522678166","msmarco_passage_59_527899182","msmarco_passage_59_530658756","msmarco_passage_59_532432550","msmarco_passage_59_538388726","msmarco_passage_59_540194895","msmarco_passage_59_541231020","msmarco_passage_59_544635763","msmarco_passage_59_546149188","msmarco_passage_59_546915795","msmarco_passage_59_550096603","msmarco_passage_59_550807800","msmarco_passage_59_551606479","msmarco_passage_59_552708354","msmarco_passage_59_556296116","msmarco_passage_59_561663192","msmarco_passage_61_465057971","msmarco_passage_61_465086089","msmarco_passage_64_62179416","msmarco_passage_65_788271940","msmarco_passage_66_41485823","msmarco_passage_66_47790089","msmarco_passage_68_652050307"]}

The original Range Rover is a full-size off-road vehicle, designed for rugged terrain and heavy-duty capabilities, with a focus on practicality and durability. It features a longer wheelbase, higher ground clearance, and a more robust suspension system, making it ideal for serious off-roading.\n\nIn contrast, the Range Rover Sport is a more agile and refined variant, blending sportiness with luxury and comfort. With its shorter wheelbase and lower ground clearance, it is better suited for on-road driving and urban environments. While still capable of handling challenging terrain, the Sport prioritizes performance and maneuverability over raw off-road prowess.\n\nFrom an engineering standpoint, both vehicles share many similarities in terms of their powertrain and mechanical components. However, the Range Rover Sport tends to have a more efficient and refined engine lineup, with a focus on delivering smooth and responsive performance on paved roads. The original Range Rover often comes with more powerful engines and a stronger emphasis on heavy-duty towing and hauling capacity.\n\nUltimately, choosing between the two vehicles depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you prioritize off-road capability and practicality, the full-size Range Rover may be the better choice. However, if you prefer a more refined and sporty driving experience in urban environments, the Range Rover Sport is an excellent option.","dids":["msmarco_passage_03_488676174","msmarco_passage_03_488686530","msmarco_passage_03_488686945","msmarco_passage_04_759219504","msmarco_passage_04_759223242","msmarco_passage_05_259696243","msmarco_passage_10_348048910","msmarco_passage_14_602257483","msmarco_passage_14_602257899","msmarco_passage_14_602333503","msmarco_passage_14_602333976","msmarco_passage_14_602367767","msmarco_passage_14_602458418","msmarco_passage_14_607759820","msmarco_passage_38_492156110","msmarco_passage_38_494075120","msmarco_passage_38_494079979","msmarco_passage_38_498013421","msmarco_passage_40_674982859","msmarco_passage_40_674987408","msmarco_passage_40_674992520","msmarco_passage_55_256616850"]}

The test measures the level of methylmalonic acid in the blood or urine, which accumulates when the body lacks sufficient vitamin B12.\n\nIn particular, it is used to detect and measure the severity of certain conditions such as methylmalonic acidemia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by an inability to break down fatty acids. The MMA test can also help diagnose other disorders that affect vitamin B12 metabolism, including pernicious anemia and homocystinuria.\n\nThe test involves measuring the concentration of methylmalonic acid in a blood or urine sample using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results are compared to reference values to determine if the level of MMA is within normal limits or elevated, indicating a potential metabolic disorder.\n\nInterpretation of the test results requires medical expertise and may involve additional testing to confirm the diagnosis.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_273235767","msmarco_passage_03_719841793","msmarco_passage_04_652472890","msmarco_passage_04_652474540","msmarco_passage_06_127448718","msmarco_passage_06_127458893","msmarco_passage_06_3120005","msmarco_passage_06_3269926","msmarco_passage_06_762877157","msmarco_passage_06_762877693","msmarco_passage_06_762878514","msmarco_passage_06_762879377","msmarco_passage_06_762882567","msmarco_passage_06_762884274","msmarco_passage_06_762884584","msmarco_passage_18_860671966","msmarco_passage_18_860687508","msmarco_passage_18_860721736","msmarco_passage_18_862989787","msmarco_passage_20_44542517","msmarco_passage_21_488344473","msmarco_passage_21_656135292","msmarco_passage_24_203994696","msmarco_passage_24_205383441","msmarco_passage_24_205385166","msmarco_passage_24_205385941","msmarco_passage_24_205386715","msmarco_passage_24_205387559","msmarco_passage_24_205390176","msmarco_passage_26_372735585","msmarco_passage_26_377385596","msmarco_passage_26_377388002","msmarco_passage_26_378685846","msmarco_passage_26_384249140","msmarco_passage_26_384257416","msmarco_passage_26_384265692","msmarco_passage_26_384273968","msmarco_passage_26_385062982","msmarco_passage_26_385065388","msmarco_passage_26_385073075","msmarco_passage_26_385075481","msmarco_passage_26_388173402","msmarco_passage_26_388184884","msmarco_passage_26_388196366","msmarco_passage_27_612379643","msmarco_passage_27_623962221","msmarco_passage_27_623966954","msmarco_passage_28_560816826","msmarco_passage_31_854283766","msmarco_passage_31_854285170","msmarco_passage_33_33410848","msmarco_passage_36_742282742","msmarco_passage_38_598846699","msmarco_passage_38_599104239","msmarco_passage_38_599241550","msmarco_passage_41_669589885","msmarco_passage_44_615851504","msmarco_passage_44_615977775","msmarco_passage_44_616052972","msmarco_passage_45_185903075","msmarco_passage_45_185913228","msmarco_passage_47_87603488","msmarco_passage_48_735874891","msmarco_passage_48_735875426","msmarco_passage_48_735876245","msmarco_passage_48_735877106","msmarco_passage_48_735881992","msmarco_passage_48_735882301","msmarco_passage_48_867940102","msmarco_passage_51_860235163","msmarco_passage_51_860428166","msmarco_passage_51_860433569","msmarco_passage_51_860838587","msmarco_passage_51_862121454","msmarco_passage_54_470408875","msmarco_passage_58_735292157","msmarco_passage_59_207803404","msmarco_passage_65_477257870","msmarco_passage_65_479670438","msmarco_passage_66_363021488","msmarco_passage_66_363022020"]}

It is centered on the ritual of consecration of bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ.\n\nThe sacrament of Holy Orders ordains men to serve the Church and its people in various capacities, such as priests, deacons, and bishops. This sacrament confers the authority to administer sacraments, preach, and lead the community in worship and ministry.\n\nIn both cases, service is a central aspect: the Eucharist brings about unity and nourishment for the faithful, while Holy Orders enables ordained ministers to serve God's people.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_649801203","msmarco_passage_01_649802047","msmarco_passage_04_788124909","msmarco_passage_06_96270236","msmarco_passage_09_688526102","msmarco_passage_09_703142068","msmarco_passage_10_489485093","msmarco_passage_10_521130068","msmarco_passage_11_339322740","msmarco_passage_15_495009012","msmarco_passage_20_678907540","msmarco_passage_20_679166403","msmarco_passage_20_679167826","msmarco_passage_20_679177999","msmarco_passage_22_468881411","msmarco_passage_31_473878569","msmarco_passage_31_474014499","msmarco_passage_31_474014999","msmarco_passage_32_625989322","msmarco_passage_33_96493256","msmarco_passage_34_59598021","msmarco_passage_34_59640285","msmarco_passage_38_189811815","msmarco_passage_38_189814851","msmarco_passage_40_9070969","msmarco_passage_41_20382800","msmarco_passage_41_23731561","msmarco_passage_52_246108062","msmarco_passage_52_770996849","msmarco_passage_52_770997296","msmarco_passage_53_195190207","msmarco_passage_56_793374220","msmarco_passage_58_289733144","msmarco_passage_58_289735902","msmarco_passage_58_582896549","msmarco_passage_65_554637961","msmarco_passage_65_715451412","msmarco_passage_68_87209129","msmarco_passage_68_87214939"]}

generally recommended to take a home pregnancy urine test after a missed period or when you first notice a missed period. This is usually around 6-12 days after ovulation, which typically occurs 14 days before the next menstrual cycle is due to start.\n\nHowever, the best time for a home pregnancy test can vary from person to person due to individual variability in hormone levels and menstrual cycles. Some women may experience early ovulation or irregular periods, while others may have longer or shorter cycles.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, it's best to wait until after your typical fertile window has passed, which is usually 5-7 days before the start of your next period. This allows for any hormonal fluctuations caused by ovulation or menstruation to stabilize, providing a more accurate reading.\n\nTaking a home pregnancy test too early can lead to false negatives, while waiting too long may result in false positives due to residual hormones from ovulation. However, if you're using a high-quality, sensitive test and following the manufacturer's instructions, you can increase your chances of getting an accurate result.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_137327187","msmarco_passage_00_137330162","msmarco_passage_00_137352249","msmarco_passage_00_137357668","msmarco_passage_00_138091560","msmarco_passage_00_183419164","msmarco_passage_00_239612976","msmarco_passage_02_181110358","msmarco_passage_02_181112366","msmarco_passage_02_390596085","msmarco_passage_02_641464125","msmarco_passage_02_641464678","msmarco_passage_02_641467190","msmarco_passage_03_463140564","msmarco_passage_03_764143400","msmarco_passage_03_8215607","msmarco_passage_04_374534646","msmarco_passage_04_374939340","msmarco_passage_04_375241745","msmarco_passage_04_375310446","msmarco_passage_04_375310833","msmarco_passage_04_477738807","msmarco_passage_04_84678409","msmarco_passage_05_387234180","msmarco_passage_06_197758296","msmarco_passage_06_370520781","msmarco_passage_06_789705806","msmarco_passage_07_478202684","msmarco_passage_08_121212749","msmarco_passage_08_23334122","msmarco_passage_08_23341339","msmarco_passage_08_426454619","msmarco_passage_08_426455483","msmarco_passage_08_426699428","msmarco_passage_08_462423950","msmarco_passage_08_61246098","msmarco_passage_08_711619846","msmarco_passage_08_711622466","msmarco_passage_08_714771715","msmarco_passage_09_36067691","msmarco_passage_09_36565547","msmarco_passage_10_629329837","msmarco_passage_10_630335283","msmarco_passage_10_886522396","msmarco_passage_11_823084759","msmarco_passage_11_823089134","msmarco_passage_11_8858858","msmarco_passage_14_777008092","msmarco_passage_17_97045571","msmarco_passage_22_508549330","msmarco_passage_22_590724126","msmarco_passage_24_246140967","msmarco_passage_25_131136165","msmarco_passage_27_150071581","msmarco_passage_27_464765209","msmarco_passage_27_612555233","msmarco_passage_28_37164819","msmarco_passage_28_467873805","msmarco_passage_29_147415208","msmarco_passage_29_468411739","msmarco_passage_31_192361612","msmarco_passage_34_772695569","msmarco_passage_35_335144532","msmarco_passage_35_472983324","msmarco_passage_36_112066186","msmarco_passage_36_112302911","msmarco_passage_36_112396967","msmarco_passage_36_158567631","msmarco_passage_36_325858411","msmarco_passage_37_592337592","msmarco_passage_38_518614745","msmarco_passage_38_607573076","msmarco_passage_38_632151469","msmarco_passage_38_632156574","msmarco_passage_38_632243235","msmarco_passage_38_632441362","msmarco_passage_38_633543190","msmarco_passage_38_634253392","msmarco_passage_38_635601500","msmarco_passage_38_635601888","msmarco_passage_39_118844285","msmarco_passage_39_98630259","msmarco_passage_39_99197132","msmarco_passage_40_465570404","msmarco_passage_40_515445277","msmarco_passage_41_623952358","msmarco_passage_42_239571720","msmarco_passage_42_857904295","msmarco_passage_44_540245844","msmarco_passage_45_471492115","msmarco_passage_46_197909458","msmarco_passage_46_370746889","msmarco_passage_46_370765247","msmarco_passage_46_370834828","msmarco_passage_48_676879309","msmarco_passage_48_711072622","msmarco_passage_48_749209638","msmarco_passage_48_750280267","msmarco_passage_48_753200302","msmarco_passage_48_774362860","msmarco_passage_48_830387392","msmarco_passage_48_838301481","msmarco_passage_48_843189234","msmarco_passage_48_848507310","msmarco_passage_49_70173791","msmarco_passage_51_539870701","msmarco_passage_53_354094593","msmarco_passage_53_354101810","msmarco_passage_53_472330829","msmarco_passage_53_472331209","msmarco_passage_53_472337967","msmarco_passage_53_472338347","msmarco_passage_53_636626110","msmarco_passage_54_180855902","msmarco_passage_54_180866174","msmarco_passage_54_180892695","msmarco_passage_54_180896345","msmarco_passage_54_240610679","msmarco_passage_54_265700064","msmarco_passage_54_271693404","msmarco_passage_54_277091143","msmarco_passage_54_277093288","msmarco_passage_55_275473874","msmarco_passage_55_297869503","msmarco_passage_55_297870367","msmarco_passage_55_298542776","msmarco_passage_55_298620253","msmarco_passage_56_503127688","msmarco_passage_56_503130308","msmarco_passage_56_503145873","msmarco_passage_57_447613267","msmarco_passage_57_447973988","msmarco_passage_57_448075881","msmarco_passage_57_448569583","msmarco_passage_57_448570025","msmarco_passage_58_426542796","msmarco_passage_59_415286787","msmarco_passage_60_322275192","msmarco_passage_65_68149734","msmarco_passage_65_808056945","msmarco_passage_65_808064779","msmarco_passage_65_816108390","msmarco_passage_65_822003588","msmarco_passage_65_849036328","msmarco_passage_65_849043823","msmarco_passage_66_16109158","msmarco_passage_66_26116223","msmarco_passage_66_3999052","msmarco_passage_66_4006513","msmarco_passage_66_814143761","msmarco_passage_67_785182925"]}

In general, early morning and late evening\/night are often considered prime times for fishing with crawfish-colored lures, as these periods coincide with peak activity of nocturnal species such as catfish, bass, and panfish. During these times, fish tend to be more active in shallower waters, making it easier to target species that are attracted to the crawfish color palette.\n\nIn warmer climates, summer months may also yield good results, particularly during periods of low water flow or when fishing at dusk or dawn. In colder climates, targeting species during the winter solstice and early morning hours can be effective, as many larger fish tend to congregate in shallower waters during these times.\n\nIt's essential to observe local currents, water temperature, and fish behavior to determine the best time for specific fishing conditions. Consulting with local fishing guides or experts familiar with the target species' behavior is also recommended to maximize success rates.","dids":["msmarco_passage_11_288630511","msmarco_passage_15_650402943","msmarco_passage_22_520043293","msmarco_passage_22_850719698","msmarco_passage_22_850848447","msmarco_passage_22_850852408","msmarco_passage_22_850852975","msmarco_passage_22_850855121","msmarco_passage_22_850856014","msmarco_passage_22_850857260","msmarco_passage_22_851693279","msmarco_passage_38_846139030","msmarco_passage_38_846164575","msmarco_passage_38_846335755","msmarco_passage_43_715301109","msmarco_passage_62_65975544"]}

This is because the gametophyte is typically the visible and reproductive structure that produces spores, while the sporophyte is usually smaller, inconspicuous, and only present for a short period. The gametophyte grows and matures first, producing gametes (sperm and eggs) which fuse to form a zygote, resulting in the development of sporophytes.

Instead, the plates slide past each other horizontally, creating a zone of deformation and faulting that can lead to earthquakes and crustal extension.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_171841690","msmarco_passage_00_641429498","msmarco_passage_00_672285818","msmarco_passage_00_787878519","msmarco_passage_00_787880357","msmarco_passage_00_787883905","msmarco_passage_00_787885743","msmarco_passage_00_854611255","msmarco_passage_00_854612899","msmarco_passage_01_398138178","msmarco_passage_01_399581151","msmarco_passage_01_401148681","msmarco_passage_01_401699608","msmarco_passage_01_402579215","msmarco_passage_01_807129368","msmarco_passage_01_810860074","msmarco_passage_01_810864322","msmarco_passage_02_448879269","msmarco_passage_02_460672600","msmarco_passage_02_460683192","msmarco_passage_02_544431271","msmarco_passage_02_822004432","msmarco_passage_03_437652637","msmarco_passage_04_152859862","msmarco_passage_04_191648759","msmarco_passage_04_198992281","msmarco_passage_04_198992956","msmarco_passage_04_198994522","msmarco_passage_04_198994915","msmarco_passage_04_198995534","msmarco_passage_04_198995962","msmarco_passage_04_199470139","msmarco_passage_04_209167611","msmarco_passage_04_209168145","msmarco_passage_04_209169682","msmarco_passage_04_209171037","msmarco_passage_04_34616188","msmarco_passage_04_85150092","msmarco_passage_05_355778210","msmarco_passage_05_742832697","msmarco_passage_05_742834535","msmarco_passage_05_843191397","msmarco_passage_05_867319797","msmarco_passage_06_280030587","msmarco_passage_06_543828709","msmarco_passage_06_545337098","msmarco_passage_06_545339433","msmarco_passage_06_83891892","msmarco_passage_07_504912452","msmarco_passage_07_505237363","msmarco_passage_07_505239577","msmarco_passage_09_43725648","msmarco_passage_10_561771439","msmarco_passage_11_714769719","msmarco_passage_11_714770694","msmarco_passage_12_226015228","msmarco_passage_12_233474783","msmarco_passage_12_534312125","msmarco_passage_12_534312965","msmarco_passage_12_536948109","msmarco_passage_15_174264331","msmarco_passage_15_297625999","msmarco_passage_15_590250517","msmarco_passage_16_407724915","msmarco_passage_16_407726749","msmarco_passage_17_122357911","msmarco_passage_17_510276449","msmarco_passage_17_510278683","msmarco_passage_17_96130540","msmarco_passage_17_96227809","msmarco_passage_19_475416662","msmarco_passage_19_753121650","msmarco_passage_22_465107528","msmarco_passage_22_470521343","msmarco_passage_22_470521780","msmarco_passage_22_471901875","msmarco_passage_22_471903366","msmarco_passage_23_288556993","msmarco_passage_23_290887728","msmarco_passage_23_292595528","msmarco_passage_23_295313684","msmarco_passage_23_296103797","msmarco_passage_23_602836538","msmarco_passage_23_604284372","msmarco_passage_23_802015408","msmarco_passage_26_114497080","msmarco_passage_26_239198396","msmarco_passage_28_195340532","msmarco_passage_28_195364349","msmarco_passage_28_864511678","msmarco_passage_28_864512468","msmarco_passage_29_192188512","msmarco_passage_29_653710296","msmarco_passage_30_26840645","msmarco_passage_30_500559858","msmarco_passage_30_580579463","msmarco_passage_30_584958974","msmarco_passage_30_630372100","msmarco_passage_30_631942524","msmarco_passage_30_651422467","msmarco_passage_30_713529433","msmarco_passage_30_714431951","msmarco_passage_30_717686399","msmarco_passage_30_720287144","msmarco_passage_30_744095419","msmarco_passage_30_753936490","msmarco_passage_30_780045514","msmarco_passage_30_791791284","msmarco_passage_31_564297888","msmarco_passage_31_577003900","msmarco_passage_31_589548261","msmarco_passage_31_589606197","msmarco_passage_31_591385965","msmarco_passage_31_593528634","msmarco_passage_31_594864752","msmarco_passage_31_602266456","msmarco_passage_31_608727495","msmarco_passage_31_608790513","msmarco_passage_31_613289509","msmarco_passage_31_622390947","msmarco_passage_31_622437912","msmarco_passage_32_480896709","msmarco_passage_32_584547635","msmarco_passage_35_174658196","msmarco_passage_36_267969153","msmarco_passage_36_444945944","msmarco_passage_37_769879200","msmarco_passage_37_769927418","msmarco_passage_39_313187575","msmarco_passage_43_811249675","msmarco_passage_44_481556946","msmarco_passage_44_586545035","msmarco_passage_44_587206698","msmarco_passage_45_349456027","msmarco_passage_45_765674779","msmarco_passage_47_463744968","msmarco_passage_47_463747303","msmarco_passage_51_719101125","msmarco_passage_51_725824341","msmarco_passage_51_725826545","msmarco_passage_54_856532365","msmarco_passage_55_657538302","msmarco_passage_55_657542914","msmarco_passage_55_657553371","msmarco_passage_57_632232213","msmarco_passage_58_274256759","msmarco_passage_59_807777255","msmarco_passage_60_80480744","msmarco_passage_62_569094999","msmarco_passage_64_118540069","msmarco_passage_64_204172919","msmarco_passage_64_227336706","msmarco_passage_65_369944174","msmarco_passage_65_370897988","msmarco_passage_65_582805089","msmarco_passage_66_233593770","msmarco_passage_68_137483145","msmarco_passage_69_21452709"]}

The service was primarily based in Munich, Germany, with broadcasts reaching millions of people across Eastern Europe during the Cold War era.\n\nRFE's content included news, analysis, and commentary on politics, economics, culture, and social issues from Western countries, as well as entertainment programs such as music, theater, and educational shows. The service also provided critical coverage of Soviet policies and actions, which helped to shape public opinion among listeners in the Soviet bloc.\n\nThroughout its existence, RFE faced challenges due to censorship restrictions imposed by communist governments in Eastern Europe, but it continued to operate secretly, often using coded language and encrypted transmissions. Despite these difficulties, RFE played an important role in promoting freedom of information and cultural exchange during the Cold War era.","dids":["msmarco_passage_02_273729003","msmarco_passage_13_612055334","msmarco_passage_19_254216961","msmarco_passage_20_544493761","msmarco_passage_20_544494898","msmarco_passage_20_544495826","msmarco_passage_20_544498564","msmarco_passage_26_865036706","msmarco_passage_27_756795461","msmarco_passage_31_859330905","msmarco_passage_39_21614560","msmarco_passage_40_167979346","msmarco_passage_40_167979702","msmarco_passage_40_91386164","msmarco_passage_49_202431613"]}

play a crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. They are specialized tube-like structures that penetrate deep into the muscle fiber, allowing them to bring the electrical signal from the surface of the cell directly to the myofibril. This enables rapid and efficient transmission of the action potential, allowing for fast contraction of the muscle fiber. The T-tubule system also facilitates the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for muscle contraction. In cardiac muscle, T-tubules are less prominent, but still present, and play a role in regulating the timing and coordination of muscle

This sudden addition of weight allowed the wagon to accelerate further, much like how an individual can contribute to the momentum of an idea or trend by joining it.\n\nIn modern usage, this idiom figuratively describes someone who rushes to support or adopt something that has already gained popularity or is deemed fashionable, often without thoroughly considering its underlying value or substance. By \"jumping on,\" these individuals are essentially hitching a ride on the coattails of others who have already invested time, effort, and enthusiasm into promoting an idea or cause.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_179094483","msmarco_passage_01_692918966","msmarco_passage_01_692920285","msmarco_passage_01_692922353","msmarco_passage_01_692922832","msmarco_passage_04_181794401","msmarco_passage_05_563788516","msmarco_passage_05_563789830","msmarco_passage_22_13900633","msmarco_passage_22_234860035","msmarco_passage_22_234925232","msmarco_passage_22_88487252","msmarco_passage_25_376869589","msmarco_passage_25_376870905","msmarco_passage_25_376872968","msmarco_passage_25_376873446","msmarco_passage_25_390046737","msmarco_passage_26_809267999","msmarco_passage_29_617232841","msmarco_passage_30_131171717","msmarco_passage_30_131172954","msmarco_passage_30_131173629","msmarco_passage_30_131174111","msmarco_passage_30_131180116","msmarco_passage_30_131200137","msmarco_passage_30_131204210","msmarco_passage_30_132524879","msmarco_passage_32_463380331","msmarco_passage_43_325713868","msmarco_passage_43_325714343","msmarco_passage_43_325718377","msmarco_passage_43_384380584","msmarco_passage_43_384381898","msmarco_passage_45_771413389","msmarco_passage_47_543222397","msmarco_passage_51_67736234","msmarco_passage_57_717166832","msmarco_passage_57_75277978","msmarco_passage_58_43442942","msmarco_passage_61_796715358","msmarco_passage_61_839109552","msmarco_passage_63_102153304","msmarco_passage_63_102156257","msmarco_passage_64_447858038","msmarco_passage_69_47594656"]}

This type of restraint is often used as a preventive measure to prevent harm or damage to national security, public safety, or other interests.\n\nFor example, prior restraint might be imposed on a journalist who is investigating and preparing to publish a story that could potentially reveal classified information about a government operation. In such cases, the court may order the journalist to cease publication until the government has had an opportunity to review and approve the content.\n\nIt's worth noting that prior restraint is distinct from post-publication review, which occurs after the material in question has been published or disseminated. Post-publication review often involves a government agency or regulator reviewing the content of a publication or speech to determine whether it presents a threat to national security or public safety. Prior restraint, on the other hand, seeks to prevent publication or dissemination from occurring in the first place.\n\nPrior restraint is generally considered a more restrictive and potentially chilling form of regulation than post-publication review, as it seeks to silence an individual or entity before they have had the opportunity to express themselves freely. As such, prior restraint is typically subject to strict judicial scrutiny and must meet high standards of justification before it can be imposed.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_580968207","msmarco_passage_01_758493061","msmarco_passage_01_791701828","msmarco_passage_02_20534481","msmarco_passage_02_24687249","msmarco_passage_02_24688154","msmarco_passage_09_618972452","msmarco_passage_10_696317784","msmarco_passage_14_109599007","msmarco_passage_14_109600230","msmarco_passage_15_407171828","msmarco_passage_16_95653147","msmarco_passage_20_487340352","msmarco_passage_20_487342363","msmarco_passage_20_487348874","msmarco_passage_26_562467771","msmarco_passage_26_565472697","msmarco_passage_26_565474089","msmarco_passage_26_565835758","msmarco_passage_26_565836663","msmarco_passage_26_616291499","msmarco_passage_28_207312971","msmarco_passage_28_207314361","msmarco_passage_28_208105259","msmarco_passage_28_209125286","msmarco_passage_28_54765497","msmarco_passage_30_632425496","msmarco_passage_30_679851780","msmarco_passage_30_685763627","msmarco_passage_30_685767821","msmarco_passage_31_544615024","msmarco_passage_33_122464696","msmarco_passage_33_122466742","msmarco_passage_33_122468689","msmarco_passage_33_122469933","msmarco_passage_41_660382296","msmarco_passage_51_687838829","msmarco_passage_52_103224724","msmarco_passage_52_103225762","msmarco_passage_52_115066891","msmarco_passage_52_91347567","msmarco_passage_54_583145265","msmarco_passage_61_260645694","msmarco_passage_61_648929118","msmarco_passage_61_672280396","msmarco_passage_61_672284759","msmarco_passage_64_194925638","msmarco_passage_64_194926047","msmarco_passage_64_194926716","msmarco_passage_64_194927232","msmarco_passage_64_212079834"]}

growth is influenced by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include genetics, age, and overall health, which can impact nail growth rate and strength.

Adequate hydration and a sufficient intake of protein are also essential for maintaining strong and healthy nails.\n\nExtrinsic factors like nail care habits and lifestyle choices can contribute to nail growth. Keeping the nails clean and dry, avoiding harsh chemicals and excessive exposure to water, and using gentle nail care tools can help promote healthy nail growth. Additionally, regular exercise, sufficient sleep, and stress management can also support overall health and nail well-being.\n\nPersonal care routines that involve applying nourishing oils or creams, such as argan oil or keratin treatments, may also aid in promoting nail growth. However, individual results may vary, and what works for one person may not work for another.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_13749545","msmarco_passage_01_310491316","msmarco_passage_01_310496622","msmarco_passage_01_310497040","msmarco_passage_01_310497584","msmarco_passage_01_310498124","msmarco_passage_02_363962692","msmarco_passage_06_785875335","msmarco_passage_07_667817211","msmarco_passage_07_667818548","msmarco_passage_07_712107780","msmarco_passage_07_716720144","msmarco_passage_08_318481098","msmarco_passage_08_325722130","msmarco_passage_09_157899682","msmarco_passage_10_330841848","msmarco_passage_10_330843972","msmarco_passage_10_330844437","msmarco_passage_10_330845810","msmarco_passage_10_330846678","msmarco_passage_10_330847537","msmarco_passage_10_632357984","msmarco_passage_10_632359467","msmarco_passage_10_632360979","msmarco_passage_10_632816881","msmarco_passage_10_821022604","msmarco_passage_10_821028146","msmarco_passage_10_821028589","msmarco_passage_10_821867114","msmarco_passage_10_821870767","msmarco_passage_10_840308666","msmarco_passage_10_840311053","msmarco_passage_10_881791901","msmarco_passage_10_882657515","msmarco_passage_11_732991852","msmarco_passage_13_13609553","msmarco_passage_13_165887177","msmarco_passage_13_79447917","msmarco_passage_13_79861544","msmarco_passage_13_8341266","msmarco_passage_13_8342907","msmarco_passage_13_8344014","msmarco_passage_13_8345348","msmarco_passage_17_227180556","msmarco_passage_17_227183078","msmarco_passage_17_227183943","msmarco_passage_17_227185278","msmarco_passage_22_10227209","msmarco_passage_22_635780858","msmarco_passage_22_635781276","msmarco_passage_22_635781820","msmarco_passage_22_653308040","msmarco_passage_22_653308468","msmarco_passage_23_342468829","msmarco_passage_23_342470210","msmarco_passage_23_342471084","msmarco_passage_23_342471840","msmarco_passage_23_342497994","msmarco_passage_23_342503187","msmarco_passage_23_342529819","msmarco_passage_23_342535412","msmarco_passage_23_342669409","msmarco_passage_23_342674670","msmarco_passage_23_342694642","msmarco_passage_23_342797576","msmarco_passage_23_342799373","msmarco_passage_23_342849392","msmarco_passage_23_342853805","msmarco_passage_23_342888840","msmarco_passage_23_342907543","msmarco_passage_23_342915070","msmarco_passage_23_451239044","msmarco_passage_23_451239489","msmarco_passage_23_451241169","msmarco_passage_24_111808392","msmarco_passage_24_128369226","msmarco_passage_24_248147491","msmarco_passage_27_640600184","msmarco_passage_28_407172669","msmarco_passage_28_407176188","msmarco_passage_28_407700054","msmarco_passage_28_472542886","msmarco_passage_28_472543822","msmarco_passage_28_472546406","msmarco_passage_29_86189240","msmarco_passage_31_45911883","msmarco_passage_32_523682906","msmarco_passage_32_523684556","msmarco_passage_33_176430245","msmarco_passage_33_176432992","msmarco_passage_33_176439880","msmarco_passage_33_48211830","msmarco_passage_34_264548710","msmarco_passage_34_294745055","msmarco_passage_35_140467622","msmarco_passage_35_140470797","msmarco_passage_35_141391298","msmarco_passage_35_141392194","msmarco_passage_35_141392634","msmarco_passage_35_141393967","msmarco_passage_35_141394444","msmarco_passage_35_141395386","msmarco_passage_35_77608386","msmarco_passage_36_414359973","msmarco_passage_36_661568514","msmarco_passage_36_661573305","msmarco_passage_37_509408647","msmarco_passage_37_640107795","msmarco_passage_38_623618119","msmarco_passage_39_175447999","msmarco_passage_40_473641307","msmarco_passage_42_793589702","msmarco_passage_43_278175899","msmarco_passage_45_321567919","msmarco_passage_45_321570650","msmarco_passage_45_321572392","msmarco_passage_45_321572801","msmarco_passage_45_826811208","msmarco_passage_45_826814875","msmarco_passage_45_826818303","msmarco_passage_45_826819142","msmarco_passage_47_707003963","msmarco_passage_47_707006902","msmarco_passage_47_707007377","msmarco_passage_48_672760762","msmarco_passage_48_672762490","msmarco_passage_48_672762926","msmarco_passage_48_813553196","msmarco_passage_49_37081822","msmarco_passage_52_200833219","msmarco_passage_53_29685182","msmarco_passage_53_403791883","msmarco_passage_53_403792845","msmarco_passage_53_403795779","msmarco_passage_53_491904517","msmarco_passage_53_491906246","msmarco_passage_54_779420757","msmarco_passage_54_779838309","msmarco_passage_55_277805733","msmarco_passage_55_277806215","msmarco_passage_55_277808786","msmarco_passage_55_289917843","msmarco_passage_55_289919437","msmarco_passage_55_289921224","msmarco_passage_55_289921636","msmarco_passage_55_289922933","msmarco_passage_55_290716322","msmarco_passage_55_290716804","msmarco_passage_55_290719375","msmarco_passage_58_805469003","msmarco_passage_60_492278073","msmarco_passage_60_495995424","msmarco_passage_60_678846516","msmarco_passage_60_678846876","msmarco_passage_61_704524568","msmarco_passage_61_704525975","msmarco_passage_61_704527328","msmarco_passage_61_704528652","msmarco_passage_64_429091926","msmarco_passage_64_429094055","msmarco_passage_64_429094521","msmarco_p

According to Marx, humans are not inherently rational, self-interested beings as often depicted by classical economics or Enlightenment thinkers. Instead, he argues that individuals are shaped by their social and economic environments, which in turn shape their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nMarx contends that human beings are \"species-being\" (Gesellschaftsmensch), meaning they exist primarily as members of a species, not as isolated individuals. He sees human nature as being characterized by a fundamental drive to survive and reproduce, but also by a tendency towards alienation and disconnection from oneself and others under capitalism.\n\nMarx's concept of \"false consciousness\" suggests that people are unaware of the social structures that influence their lives, leading them to perceive their own interests and needs in terms of individualistic goals rather than collective ones. This false consciousness is seen as a result of capitalist ideology, which distorts individuals' understanding of themselves and their place within society.\n\nThrough his critiques of capitalism and human nature, Marx aims to challenge the dominant ideologies of his time and promote a more nuanced understanding of human existence, one that acknowledges the complex interplay between individual agency and social structures.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_605994127","msmarco_passage_02_160372072","msmarco_passage_02_44895832","msmarco_passage_02_466165211","msmarco_passage_02_674764284","msmarco_passage_02_866003500","msmarco_passage_02_866003886","msmarco_passage_02_866004287","msmarco_passage_02_866005057","msmarco_passage_02_866005460","msmarco_passage_03_166241473","msmarco_passage_03_177758489","msmarco_passage_03_748129268","msmarco_passage_03_748131357","msmarco_passage_07_847844617","msmarco_passage_09_140011759","msmarco_passage_11_166107736","msmarco_passage_11_166108163","msmarco_passage_11_166228873","msmarco_passage_13_70612666","msmarco_passage_13_70613277","msmarco_passage_13_70613742","msmarco_passage_15_95579700","msmarco_passage_16_115822662","msmarco_passage_16_115832942","msmarco_passage_18_687473586","msmarco_passage_18_687474409","msmarco_passage_18_687474867","msmarco_passage_19_600378659","msmarco_passage_19_863303212","msmarco_passage_19_863328013","msmarco_passage_19_863328959","msmarco_passage_19_863330863","msmarco_passage_19_863331710","msmarco_passage_19_863333862","msmarco_passage_19_863334298","msmarco_passage_19_863336087","msmarco_passage_19_863348856","msmarco_passage_19_863525564","msmarco_passage_20_614379745","msmarco_passage_20_738721519","msmarco_passage_20_738724479","msmarco_passage_20_816970216","msmarco_passage_23_565443249","msmarco_passage_25_730725803","msmarco_passage_26_38304631","msmarco_passage_30_426014433","msmarco_passage_30_788454392","msmarco_passage_31_266630543","msmarco_passage_32_459876609","msmarco_passage_32_459876976","msmarco_passage_32_459877642","msmarco_passage_32_459878096","msmarco_passage_33_123609991","msmarco_passage_34_450357808","msmarco_passage_34_450358259","msmarco_passage_35_127127848","msmarco_passage_40_164637888","msmarco_passage_42_171735269","msmarco_passage_42_585499015","msmarco_passage_42_585502857","msmarco_passage_43_530797423","msmarco_passage_46_51230446","msmarco_passage_46_51231158","msmarco_passage_53_217835321","msmarco_passage_53_217840571","msmarco_passage_53_217842440","msmarco_passage_53_217844697","msmarco_passage_53_217851755","msmarco_passage_53_217856285","msmarco_passage_53_217863157","msmarco_passage_53_217863706","msmarco_passage_53_217876236","msmarco_passage_53_218457851","msmarco_passage_58_285516305","msmarco_passage_58_285516724","msmarco_passage_60_709560524","msmarco_passage_61_664046466","msmarco_passage_61_82672185","msmarco_passage_62_803644996","msmarco_passage_62_805891320","msmarco_passage_62_805891699","msmarco_passage_68_626173617","msmarco_passage_68_626174043","msmarco_passage_68_626346262"]}

These improvements can include structural changes such as adding a new wing or renovating existing facilities, as well as non-structural additions like installing new elevators or installing security systems.\n\nTo qualify as a building improvement, the expenditure must meet certain criteria. It is typically defined as an expenditure that increases the property's value or useful life beyond its original cost. Improvements are usually capitalized and recorded on the balance sheet as part of the property's asset base.\n\nExamples of building improvements include installing new HVAC systems, upgrading electrical infrastructure, and adding insulation to a building's exterior walls. These types of enhancements are considered long-term investments that increase the property's value and should be recorded as assets rather than expenses.\n\nIn contrast, expenditures like painting the interior or replacing light fixtures are considered maintenance costs and are expensed in the year incurred. Building improvements must be substantiated by documentation, such as contracts or invoices, to ensure that they meet the definition of a capital asset under accounting standards.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_476205257","msmarco_passage_01_224738237","msmarco_passage_01_275892294","msmarco_passage_01_277456306","msmarco_passage_01_277710372","msmarco_passage_01_277712129","msmarco_passage_01_626851612","msmarco_passage_01_854514216","msmarco_passage_03_326127049","msmarco_passage_03_36759108","msmarco_passage_03_36759505","msmarco_passage_03_36760115","msmarco_passage_03_389759476","msmarco_passage_03_48910402","msmarco_passage_03_762666949","msmarco_passage_03_762691272","msmarco_passage_04_681974422","msmarco_passage_04_684975549","msmarco_passage_05_135674353","msmarco_passage_05_33697921","msmarco_passage_05_464970906","msmarco_passage_06_354083880","msmarco_passage_07_451728159","msmarco_passage_08_272879824","msmarco_passage_09_816991176","msmarco_passage_10_117184096","msmarco_passage_10_493882798","msmarco_passage_10_493909355","msmarco_passage_10_493910400","msmarco_passage_12_753992983","msmarco_passage_13_448038167","msmarco_passage_13_459891949","msmarco_passage_13_480791464","msmarco_passage_13_485722979","msmarco_passage_13_625879431","msmarco_passage_13_64687419","msmarco_passage_13_801163455","msmarco_passage_16_93298671","msmarco_passage_17_254725197","msmarco_passage_18_283379993","msmarco_passage_18_779067183","msmarco_passage_22_166257337","msmarco_passage_22_412138196","msmarco_passage_22_412147121","msmarco_passage_22_422263704","msmarco_passage_22_621731564","msmarco_passage_22_621770950","msmarco_passage_22_621771817","msmarco_passage_22_621924326","msmarco_passage_24_715430360","msmarco_passage_24_736294064","msmarco_passage_24_765072650","msmarco_passage_24_785771535","msmarco_passage_24_814874296","msmarco_passage_26_361480211","msmarco_passage_26_361491610","msmarco_passage_26_547764996","msmarco_passage_27_395017839","msmarco_passage_28_211873900","msmarco_passage_28_702697091","msmarco_passage_30_102386141","msmarco_passage_30_102389312","msmarco_passage_30_102389671","msmarco_passage_30_329040387","msmarco_passage_31_177364075","msmarco_passage_32_353882968","msmarco_passage_35_179809224","msmarco_passage_36_324479374","msmarco_passage_36_324481872","msmarco_passage_36_401544332","msmarco_passage_36_855563876","msmarco_passage_37_1152174","msmarco_passage_37_24669363","msmarco_passage_37_2922237","msmarco_passage_37_526250240","msmarco_passage_39_439686685","msmarco_passage_39_733374473","msmarco_passage_40_577167798","msmarco_passage_40_632516512","msmarco_passage_42_122218754","msmarco_passage_43_124434368","msmarco_passage_46_169114777","msmarco_passage_46_170818700","msmarco_passage_46_325041853","msmarco_passage_46_608297856","msmarco_passage_46_608301346","msmarco_passage_47_41604318","msmarco_passage_47_482126448","msmarco_passage_49_389692110","msmarco_passage_49_391526510","msmarco_passage_51_194060182","msmarco_passage_51_626707336","msmarco_passage_51_85024864","msmarco_passage_52_19827738","msmarco_passage_53_127777456","msmarco_passage_53_809940420","msmarco_passage_54_206928994","msmarco_passage_55_485571055","msmarco_passage_58_788710801","msmarco_passage_58_802302384","msmarco_passage_58_848438460","msmarco_passage_59_713495952","msmarco_passage_59_715271086","msmarco_passage_59_715740067","msmarco_passage_61_484371210","msmarco_passage_61_555330893","msmarco_passage_62_158414995","msmarco_passage_62_158449280","msmarco_passage_62_158451062","msmarco_passage_62_158646432","msmarco_passage_62_164842105","msmarco_passage_62_626655293","msmarco_passage_62_645857526","msmarco_passage_62_716197882","msmarco_passage_63_169808255","msmarco_passage_64_335718313"]}
