In various settings, such as hospitals, hospices, or community organizations, a family advocate typically serves as a liaison between the individual and their loved ones, healthcare providers, and social services.\n\nFor instance, in a hospital setting, a family advocate might help facilitate communication between patients and their families about medical treatment options, palliative care, and end-of-life care. They may also assist with navigating complex healthcare systems, accessing resources, and advocating for the patient's needs within the hospital. Additionally, family advocates may provide emotional support and connect families with local community resources, such as counseling services or support groups.\n\nIn other settings, such as hospices or palliative care programs, a family advocate might focus on supporting individuals who are terminally ill and their families through the dying process. They may help facilitate conversations about advance care planning, provide guidance on accessing resources like pain management and symptom relief, and connect families with local bereavement support groups.\n\nOverall, the role of a family advocate is to empower families to make informed decisions about their loved one's care, providing emotional support, advocacy, and connection to community resources whenever needed.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_484158482","msmarco_passage_00_484158910","msmarco_passage_00_546316493","msmarco_passage_00_674877596","msmarco_passage_01_364712928","msmarco_passage_01_575386250","msmarco_passage_02_441323410","msmarco_passage_03_647665121","msmarco_passage_03_651244432","msmarco_passage_03_681960035","msmarco_passage_03_768554664","msmarco_passage_03_805668871","msmarco_passage_05_3281234","msmarco_passage_07_125122427","msmarco_passage_07_619672358","msmarco_passage_08_527802396","msmarco_passage_08_592728689","msmarco_passage_08_809101525","msmarco_passage_09_598610396","msmarco_passage_10_501527721","msmarco_passage_11_168436219","msmarco_passage_11_169237332","msmarco_passage_11_239970760","msmarco_passage_14_531601888","msmarco_passage_14_558585408","msmarco_passage_14_558585919","msmarco_passage_20_369361207","msmarco_passage_24_280348485","msmarco_passage_24_660233795","msmarco_passage_26_453450060","msmarco_passage_26_92748985","msmarco_passage_26_92752918","msmarco_passage_27_867448104","msmarco_passage_29_113785372","msmarco_passage_29_117271992","msmarco_passage_29_117273504","msmarco_passage_29_117274835","msmarco_passage_30_222252514","msmarco_passage_30_222253509","msmarco_passage_31_870240959","msmarco_passage_35_388912014","msmarco_passage_35_626734779","msmarco_passage_36_736938854","msmarco_passage_36_752117934","msmarco_passage_36_842532035","msmarco_passage_38_214849207","msmarco_passage_38_691802685","msmarco_passage_39_168159862","msmarco_passage_39_296093662","msmarco_passage_39_296094151","msmarco_passage_39_296094560","msmarco_passage_40_38522247","msmarco_passage_40_685780366","msmarco_passage_40_749738898","msmarco_passage_40_861153173","msmarco_passage_41_148506778","msmarco_passage_41_167139160","msmarco_passage_41_433454024","msmarco_passage_41_433454408","msmarco_passage_41_434594649","msmarco_passage_41_434993075","msmarco_passage_41_528200614","msmarco_passage_41_826560457","msmarco_passage_42_760106977","msmarco_passage_42_762366291","msmarco_passage_43_654111779","msmarco_passage_44_613043576","msmarco_passage_44_775846642","msmarco_passage_46_371047845","msmarco_passage_47_79247040","msmarco_passage_47_79251031","msmarco_passage_48_441890923","msmarco_passage_49_16734557","msmarco_passage_50_498122787","msmarco_passage_50_499350069","msmarco_passage_50_522613653","msmarco_passage_50_522616091","msmarco_passage_51_405292169","msmarco_passage_53_157831992","msmarco_passage_54_127111419","msmarco_passage_54_127111786","msmarco_passage_54_127232652","msmarco_passage_54_127242840","msmarco_passage_54_127243193","msmarco_passage_54_127243618","msmarco_passage_54_651251890","msmarco_passage_54_766699199","msmarco_passage_55_694857361","msmarco_passage_56_92915858","msmarco_passage_58_748236688","msmarco_passage_59_727329438","msmarco_passage_59_91672852","msmarco_passage_62_10069987","msmarco_passage_62_206413611","msmarco_passage_62_752992116","msmarco_passage_62_827931488","msmarco_passage_63_582794819","msmarco_passage_64_44460766","msmarco_passage_65_600509314","msmarco_passage_65_718578546","msmarco_passage_65_819525559","msmarco_passage_68_214047881","msmarco_passage_68_27251140","msmarco_passage_68_826285209"]}

Cut sections of about 3-4 inches long from the stem, making a clean cut just above a node using a sharp knife or pruning tool. Remove lower leaves and trim any damaged or woody sections.\n\nNext, prepare a rooting medium such as perlite, vermiculite, or a mix specifically designed for cacti and succulents. Moisten the medium with water until it's damp but not soaking wet.\n\nPlant the cut sections in the moistened medium, burying them up to the node. Water sparingly at first, allowing the medium to dry slightly between waterings. Provide bright, indirect light and maintain temperatures between 65-75\u00b0F (18-24\u00b0C). Keep the humidity around 40-50%.\n\nOver time, roots should develop within 2-3 weeks. Transplant the rooted yucca into a larger pot once new growth appears, using a well-draining potting mix specifically designed for cacti and succulents.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_278400966","msmarco_passage_06_523275607","msmarco_passage_06_523299019","msmarco_passage_23_171925017","msmarco_passage_23_181855918","msmarco_passage_24_730992202","msmarco_passage_24_809779284","msmarco_passage_24_829015718","msmarco_passage_24_829018260","msmarco_passage_24_859276750","msmarco_passage_24_859277638","msmarco_passage_26_479279455","msmarco_passage_27_145459830","msmarco_passage_28_484921483","msmarco_passage_30_16383983","msmarco_passage_30_16384414","msmarco_passage_33_194296212","msmarco_passage_33_195562378","msmarco_passage_33_195583510","msmarco_passage_33_195814649","msmarco_passage_33_196055718","msmarco_passage_35_435258963","msmarco_passage_37_712356783","msmarco_passage_38_98984681","msmarco_passage_40_463788638","msmarco_passage_44_88833464","msmarco_passage_47_246355036","msmarco_passage_47_255515890","msmarco_passage_47_257938448","msmarco_passage_47_260872890","msmarco_passage_47_260873373","msmarco_passage_47_311119229","msmarco_passage_47_319864824","msmarco_passage_47_326495769","msmarco_passage_48_278936880","msmarco_passage_56_361140675","msmarco_passage_57_189292382","msmarco_passage_63_703143621","msmarco_passage_64_671550861","msmarco_passage_64_671551313"]}

On average, a baby rabbit (kits) will grow to about 75% of their adult size within the first few weeks of life, reaching full maturity in approximately 6-8 months.\n\nAs for individual rabbits, growth rates can be influenced by various factors, such as diet quality, exercise, and genetics. For example, a well-fed and exercised rabbit may reach its maximum weight faster than one that is malnourished or sedentary.\n\nOn average, domesticated rabbits can grow around 1-2 pounds (0.5-1 kg) per month during the first year of life, with some breeds growing faster or slower depending on their specific characteristics. However, this rate of growth can slow down significantly after the first year as the rabbit reaches physical maturity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that rabbits, especially those bred for show or competition, may be intentionally bred to reach certain weights or sizes by a specific age, which can affect their overall growth rate and development.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_154951652","msmarco_passage_00_155544616","msmarco_passage_00_157536361","msmarco_passage_00_167727836","msmarco_passage_02_701739940","msmarco_passage_03_365669332","msmarco_passage_03_534863660","msmarco_passage_04_117224356","msmarco_passage_04_180598620","msmarco_passage_04_549935625","msmarco_passage_04_99670055","msmarco_passage_05_367134241","msmarco_passage_08_787119685","msmarco_passage_09_677551682","msmarco_passage_10_217349788","msmarco_passage_10_536303926","msmarco_passage_10_862617387","msmarco_passage_11_16728087","msmarco_passage_11_588018741","msmarco_passage_12_232859249","msmarco_passage_12_50955131","msmarco_passage_12_620759634","msmarco_passage_12_620761599","msmarco_passage_14_320447804","msmarco_passage_14_320546046","msmarco_passage_15_528626307","msmarco_passage_17_599722241","msmarco_passage_17_599727728","msmarco_passage_21_80348727","msmarco_passage_22_523239798","msmarco_passage_22_523240949","msmarco_passage_22_612531229","msmarco_passage_22_612531644","msmarco_passage_22_662853245","msmarco_passage_25_221556706","msmarco_passage_28_461708742","msmarco_passage_29_698725528","msmarco_passage_29_703659962","msmarco_passage_29_726019734","msmarco_passage_30_815610016","msmarco_passage_30_815846416","msmarco_passage_30_816245182","msmarco_passage_30_869441269","msmarco_passage_31_491629350","msmarco_passage_31_602882803","msmarco_passage_31_602883268","msmarco_passage_32_689392896","msmarco_passage_32_689489413","msmarco_passage_36_220226824","msmarco_passage_38_24903811","msmarco_passage_38_27615411","msmarco_passage_38_29802120","msmarco_passage_40_636124918","msmarco_passage_40_723043343","msmarco_passage_42_822851320","msmarco_passage_53_765391520","msmarco_passage_54_251704740","msmarco_passage_54_251706219","msmarco_passage_54_251708359","msmarco_passage_54_378025776","msmarco_passage_54_379021042","msmarco_passage_56_420110989","msmarco_passage_56_851922104","msmarco_passage_56_861734037","msmarco_passage_57_2753613","msmarco_passage_58_632432001","msmarco_passage_58_633783425","msmarco_passage_58_633912498","msmarco_passage_58_633912960","msmarco_passage_58_633914812","msmarco_passage_58_634003012","msmarco_passage_58_634007049","msmarco_passage_59_54510958","msmarco_passage_60_700100293","msmarco_passage_67_701546391"]}

Mathematically, if we have two powers with the same base, denoted as 'a' raised to different exponents 'm' and 'n', the quotient is calculated by subtracting the exponent of the divisor from the exponent of the dividend.\n\nFor example, consider (2^5) \/ (2^3). Here, we have the same base 2 but different exponents 5 and 3. According to the rule, when we divide two powers with the same base, we subtract the exponent of the divisor from the exponent of the dividend. Therefore, in this case, (2^5) \/ (2^3) equals 2^(5-3), which simplifies to 2^2 or 4.\n\nThis concept is essential in algebra and calculus, as it helps us simplify complex expressions involving exponents.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_22696500","msmarco_passage_01_244266896","msmarco_passage_01_466715450","msmarco_passage_02_599966287","msmarco_passage_03_164165794","msmarco_passage_03_164167641","msmarco_passage_03_164168152","msmarco_passage_03_164169123","msmarco_passage_03_164169948","msmarco_passage_03_164171340","msmarco_passage_03_844370865","msmarco_passage_04_158891151","msmarco_passage_07_854203342","msmarco_passage_07_854258442","msmarco_passage_08_139540897","msmarco_passage_08_139545051","msmarco_passage_08_228685819","msmarco_passage_08_229147245","msmarco_passage_08_230497249","msmarco_passage_08_230499844","msmarco_passage_08_230500344","msmarco_passage_09_616550748","msmarco_passage_12_185292708","msmarco_passage_12_535429915","msmarco_passage_14_386014688","msmarco_passage_14_499879134","msmarco_passage_15_567093044","msmarco_passage_15_590564441","msmarco_passage_15_603948769","msmarco_passage_22_152483381","msmarco_passage_22_152484305","msmarco_passage_22_152485767","msmarco_passage_23_605174084","msmarco_passage_24_493347833","msmarco_passage_27_194367061","msmarco_passage_27_194420446","msmarco_passage_27_368771709","msmarco_passage_27_374632049","msmarco_passage_27_374632604","msmarco_passage_28_207261579","msmarco_passage_28_662973565","msmarco_passage_29_657459591","msmarco_passage_31_523810788","msmarco_passage_31_615334270","msmarco_passage_31_618734032","msmarco_passage_31_619813601","msmarco_passage_32_241735462","msmarco_passage_32_484076570","msmarco_passage_40_25690550","msmarco_passage_40_25694792","msmarco_passage_41_435310294","msmarco_passage_41_660065178","msmarco_passage_42_865359959","msmarco_passage_44_505957417","msmarco_passage_44_506036040","msmarco_passage_44_510388881","msmarco_passage_47_390162831","msmarco_passage_51_581991123","msmarco_passage_51_840859298","msmarco_passage_51_841039128","msmarco_passage_51_841039619","msmarco_passage_51_841041131","msmarco_passage_53_232136335","msmarco_passage_53_284436965","msmarco_passage_53_284437918","msmarco_passage_53_287626488","msmarco_passage_53_287759952","msmarco_passage_53_287787589","msmarco_passage_53_287788880","msmarco_passage_53_287789642","msmarco_passage_53_289872920","msmarco_passage_53_307696219","msmarco_passage_54_345332134","msmarco_passage_56_105029636","msmarco_passage_57_555511272","msmarco_passage_57_555673738","msmarco_passage_57_555681462","msmarco_passage_59_694307028","msmarco_passage_59_794499704","msmarco_passage_61_612767904","msmarco_passage_61_612997857","msmarco_passage_61_613381561","msmarco_passage_61_613598933","msmarco_passage_61_613787940","msmarco_passage_61_613825073","msmarco_passage_61_652427194","msmarco_passage_61_675950537","msmarco_passage_65_708759865","msmarco_passage_65_708889170","msmarco_passage_65_708890487","msmarco_passage_65_708891412","msmarco_passage_65_711659378","msmarco_passage_65_712387771","msmarco_passage_67_261361246","msmarco_passage_67_312932308","msmarco_passage_67_312933169","msmarco_passage_67_312936245","msmarco_passage_67_657223660","msmarco_passage_68_865146816"]}

In some cases, it is used in combination with trimethoprim, another antibiotic, to treat urinary tract infections caused by E. coli bacteria.\n\nIt's worth noting that Septrin should only be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it can cause side effects and interact with other medications.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_185889194","msmarco_passage_00_186164070","msmarco_passage_00_276192879","msmarco_passage_02_229793325","msmarco_passage_04_652152937","msmarco_passage_08_77528540","msmarco_passage_08_858995903","msmarco_passage_09_270361117","msmarco_passage_09_287276476","msmarco_passage_09_500649377","msmarco_passage_16_462315186","msmarco_passage_20_745958081","msmarco_passage_26_232088463","msmarco_passage_33_480641286","msmarco_passage_35_84429262","msmarco_passage_36_641066424","msmarco_passage_36_644238277","msmarco_passage_36_644239197","msmarco_passage_36_644240431","msmarco_passage_36_644241774","msmarco_passage_36_644247311","msmarco_passage_45_629912999","msmarco_passage_46_283928895","msmarco_passage_48_58378886","msmarco_passage_48_606610106","msmarco_passage_48_60966667","msmarco_passage_48_67767784","msmarco_passage_48_69079197","msmarco_passage_53_469061176","msmarco_passage_53_627489171","msmarco_passage_55_359051507","msmarco_passage_59_519466424","msmarco_passage_59_520083258","msmarco_passage_66_667179984"]}

This occurs when there is an insulating layer or gap between the two objects, allowing convective heat transfer to be minimal and thus reducing overall heat exchange rates. In practice, cold bridging is often encountered in building insulation applications, where it can lead to reduced thermal performance and increased energy consumption if not properly addressed through design and material selection.","dids":["msmarco_passage_03_588975274","msmarco_passage_06_381645118","msmarco_passage_07_619017467","msmarco_passage_09_412847729","msmarco_passage_09_750520952","msmarco_passage_13_347068748","msmarco_passage_16_870480032","msmarco_passage_21_284739029","msmarco_passage_21_284740036","msmarco_passage_21_284741508","msmarco_passage_23_461087648","msmarco_passage_24_815973608","msmarco_passage_24_815976462","msmarco_passage_28_501246443","msmarco_passage_28_501247489","msmarco_passage_28_501248689","msmarco_passage_34_524088628","msmarco_passage_39_822140730","msmarco_passage_42_246720415","msmarco_passage_44_693194499","msmarco_passage_44_701113764","msmarco_passage_44_702827098","msmarco_passage_44_702827524","msmarco_passage_49_395156392","msmarco_passage_49_395261293","msmarco_passage_49_702444326","msmarco_passage_49_771503789","msmarco_passage_56_411147711","msmarco_passage_56_507006671","msmarco_passage_57_595025906","msmarco_passage_59_230189996","msmarco_passage_62_724691796","msmarco_passage_64_586346859","msmarco_passage_65_702914149","msmarco_passage_68_677222984","msmarco_passage_69_120480789"]}

This is supported by the fact that many settlements in the region have names ending in \"-wold\" or \"-holt.\" However, other theories propose connections with the Celts, who may have used the name \"Kotswold\" to describe the area, and even a possible link to the Old Norse word \"kot,\" meaning a hill or a mound. Despite these various interpretations, the true origin of the name \"Cotswolds\" remains a topic of debate among historians and linguists.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_643075452","msmarco_passage_09_762542310","msmarco_passage_10_563678056","msmarco_passage_62_842819745","msmarco_passage_64_806622250","msmarco_passage_68_94748394"]}

The colony's primary motivation for establishing the colony was to create a haven for these conservative Protestants, who sought to escape what they saw as corrupt and unorthodox practices within the Church of England. They envisioned a new society built on biblical principles, with a strong emphasis on education, community, and spiritual purity.\n\nThe Puritans were largely led by wealthy investors from London, including John Mason and Samuel Fuller, who pooled their resources to sponsor Winthrop's expedition. The colony was established on the eastern coast of North America, where it would be isolated from the conflicts of England and able to establish its own distinct identity.\n\nInitially, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was a successful commercial venture, with the establishment of trade relationships with Native American tribes and the exportation of furs and other commodities. However, it soon became clear that economic gain alone could not sustain the colony, and the Puritans' emphasis on spiritual purity and community became increasingly important in shaping their governance and social structures.\n\nIn 1630, Winthrop was elected as governor of the colony, marking a turning point in its development. Under his leadership, the Massachusetts Bay Colony began to take shape as a distinctly Protestant and self-governing entity, with a strong emphasis on education, community, and spiritual discipline.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_2064501","msmarco_passage_00_600519808","msmarco_passage_01_589776442","msmarco_passage_01_590090111","msmarco_passage_01_68137973","msmarco_passage_02_137876690","msmarco_passage_02_137878430","msmarco_passage_03_285662706","msmarco_passage_03_319849236","msmarco_passage_03_319872045","msmarco_passage_03_487008787","msmarco_passage_03_79036337","msmarco_passage_04_220519623","msmarco_passage_04_220521435","msmarco_passage_04_60471621","msmarco_passage_05_251725255","msmarco_passage_06_135230047","msmarco_passage_07_295610188","msmarco_passage_07_295610597","msmarco_passage_09_725502527","msmarco_passage_09_730089941","msmarco_passage_11_87638619","msmarco_passage_14_119469606","msmarco_passage_14_139380890","msmarco_passage_14_140671074","msmarco_passage_14_861613091","msmarco_passage_15_560144618","msmarco_passage_15_560151877","msmarco_passage_15_86461504","msmarco_passage_15_92771994","msmarco_passage_15_98222798","msmarco_passage_15_98224011","msmarco_passage_19_245440861","msmarco_passage_19_260173703","msmarco_passage_22_471410477","msmarco_passage_22_472762171","msmarco_passage_22_473005130","msmarco_passage_24_618479545","msmarco_passage_26_530544319","msmarco_passage_29_364475260","msmarco_passage_29_761281450","msmarco_passage_29_773104460","msmarco_passage_30_297660383","msmarco_passage_30_608569458","msmarco_passage_30_683793897","msmarco_passage_30_727139213","msmarco_passage_30_778588658","msmarco_passage_30_788720340","msmarco_passage_33_120383696","msmarco_passage_33_120384583","msmarco_passage_33_120388383","msmarco_passage_34_210745876","msmarco_passage_34_210780712","msmarco_passage_34_382434473","msmarco_passage_37_815086624","msmarco_passage_37_815237580","msmarco_passage_38_804904838","msmarco_passage_40_221252583","msmarco_passage_41_663806452","msmarco_passage_45_252295761","msmarco_passage_45_332807215","msmarco_passage_45_352715030","msmarco_passage_45_376555357","msmarco_passage_45_387648831","msmarco_passage_45_387649872","msmarco_passage_51_151829073","msmarco_passage_51_689661679","msmarco_passage_52_21175196","msmarco_passage_52_302819938","msmarco_passage_59_52929995","msmarco_passage_60_547554064","msmarco_passage_61_660048283","msmarco_passage_61_661391991","msmarco_passage_61_663551975","msmarco_passage_61_663552828","msmarco_passage_61_663553610","msmarco_passage_61_663557754","msmarco_passage_61_668564937","msmarco_passage_61_669836996","msmarco_passage_61_670691035","msmarco_passage_61_672702678","msmarco_passage_61_672704775","msmarco_passage_62_595836915","msmarco_passage_62_595837306","msmarco_passage_64_89707734","msmarco_passage_64_89725907","msmarco_passage_65_55166597","msmarco_passage_66_289406392","msmarco_passage_68_145641650","msmarco_passage_68_206021260"]}

Individuals can reduce their risk of infection by practicing good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing with soap and water, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for someone infected or suspected of being infected, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of Ebola.\n\nCommunity-level prevention measures include establishing and maintaining safe burial practices, ensuring that healthcare workers wear PPE during contact with patients and performing proper cleaning and disinfection of surfaces. Health systems should implement protocols for rapid identification and isolation of cases, conduct early case contact tracing to identify contacts, provide prompt and effective treatment to those infected, and monitor vaccination efforts.\n\nFurthermore, healthcare facilities can take steps such as maintaining asepsis in clinics, including sterilization of equipment and surface cleaning, implementing infection control measures, providing education on safe behaviors for patients, staff, and visitors.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_419716404","msmarco_passage_01_498858624","msmarco_passage_02_266884029","msmarco_passage_02_408002269","msmarco_passage_02_422469857","msmarco_passage_03_585934954","msmarco_passage_03_585939311","msmarco_passage_03_732241492","msmarco_passage_05_621274976","msmarco_passage_05_751826591","msmarco_passage_06_119801283","msmarco_passage_06_119801742","msmarco_passage_06_245930731","msmarco_passage_06_250911935","msmarco_passage_07_104279313","msmarco_passage_07_665438273","msmarco_passage_07_796115535","msmarco_passage_08_385029851","msmarco_passage_08_463741689","msmarco_passage_08_463743649","msmarco_passage_08_4759767","msmarco_passage_08_4861443","msmarco_passage_08_4863299","msmarco_passage_08_583963297","msmarco_passage_08_597161019","msmarco_passage_08_9238300","msmarco_passage_10_623379887","msmarco_passage_10_623381672","msmarco_passage_10_623382587","msmarco_passage_10_732816327","msmarco_passage_17_37409134","msmarco_passage_22_255500529","msmarco_passage_27_607462358","msmarco_passage_27_607464066","msmarco_passage_32_181871819","msmarco_passage_33_37211472","msmarco_passage_36_837861396","msmarco_passage_37_201816391","msmarco_passage_38_590417156","msmarco_passage_41_105593495","msmarco_passage_41_176577541","msmarco_passage_41_182032972","msmarco_passage_41_182033318","msmarco_passage_41_182038127","msmarco_passage_41_182167119","msmarco_passage_41_182189175","msmarco_passage_41_472603883","msmarco_passage_41_829371565","msmarco_passage_41_829372464","msmarco_passage_45_193852750","msmarco_passage_45_327279495","msmarco_passage_45_327279951","msmarco_passage_45_327280966","msmarco_passage_45_327281380","msmarco_passage_45_327282218","msmarco_passage_45_327283517","msmarco_passage_45_327283926","msmarco_passage_45_327284400","msmarco_passage_45_327284854","msmarco_passage_45_327285298","msmarco_passage_45_327285853","msmarco_passage_45_609471620","msmarco_passage_45_609472047","msmarco_passage_47_351827631","msmarco_passage_49_248909462","msmarco_passage_49_470036002","msmarco_passage_49_470036826","msmarco_passage_49_470037786","msmarco_passage_49_711786957","msmarco_passage_52_594252696","msmarco_passage_53_470955403","msmarco_passage_53_470956607","msmarco_passage_53_773174054","msmarco_passage_53_773178011","msmarco_passage_53_773178475","msmarco_passage_54_850572021","msmarco_passage_54_850574428","msmarco_passage_55_180661121","msmarco_passage_55_180662078","msmarco_passage_55_312207455","msmarco_passage_55_418566926","msmarco_passage_56_841530438","msmarco_passage_58_258550634","msmarco_passage_61_9762289","msmarco_passage_63_573055485","msmarco_passage_66_86238342","msmarco_passage_68_155782445","msmarco_passage_68_207088892"]}

Rinse the tenderloins under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Season both sides of the pork with a mixture of salt, pepper, and any other desired herbs or spices, such as garlic powder, paprika, or thyme.\n\nPlace the pork steaks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch of space between each steak. Drizzle with olive oil and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the meat to relax.\n\nBake the pork tenderloins in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes per pound, or until they reach an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C). The thickness of the steaks will affect cooking time, so use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. Once cooked, remove from the oven and let rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.\n\nTo achieve a crispy exterior and juicy interior, you can broil the pork for an additional 1-2 minutes per side after baking. Keep a close eye on the steaks during this step, as overcooking can occur quickly.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_109016022","msmarco_passage_00_114408092","msmarco_passage_00_405588494","msmarco_passage_00_462471343","msmarco_passage_00_630410357","msmarco_passage_02_518800971","msmarco_passage_03_317312110","msmarco_passage_03_580451988","msmarco_passage_03_705363226","msmarco_passage_04_512401452","msmarco_passage_04_512403624","msmarco_passage_06_196282984","msmarco_passage_06_408130204","msmarco_passage_06_408312196","msmarco_passage_06_410025760","msmarco_passage_06_410511136","msmarco_passage_06_416822237","msmarco_passage_06_417267121","msmarco_passage_06_417283952","msmarco_passage_06_463451529","msmarco_passage_07_303366483","msmarco_passage_07_303463011","msmarco_passage_07_516377886","msmarco_passage_07_711507172","msmarco_passage_07_838971230","msmarco_passage_08_501299346","msmarco_passage_09_410271218","msmarco_passage_09_410272734","msmarco_passage_09_534379317","msmarco_passage_10_160837478","msmarco_passage_10_396891970","msmarco_passage_10_396894077","msmarco_passage_10_783890921","msmarco_passage_10_783892290","msmarco_passage_10_783898551","msmarco_passage_11_537346235","msmarco_passage_12_226467441","msmarco_passage_13_788100041","msmarco_passage_14_571515847","msmarco_passage_16_296273565","msmarco_passage_16_296326800","msmarco_passage_16_296329390","msmarco_passage_23_159175317","msmarco_passage_24_315486654","msmarco_passage_25_860633786","msmarco_passage_26_706280346","msmarco_passage_26_706280775","msmarco_passage_28_439751437","msmarco_passage_28_441067818","msmarco_passage_29_275096685","msmarco_passage_29_278996104","msmarco_passage_29_287466613","msmarco_passage_31_58840134","msmarco_passage_31_58840581","msmarco_passage_31_81615044","msmarco_passage_31_81620187","msmarco_passage_31_84621957","msmarco_passage_31_86107338","msmarco_passage_32_616057018","msmarco_passage_33_226064399","msmarco_passage_33_502768919","msmarco_passage_33_581753166","msmarco_passage_33_581756146","msmarco_passage_34_461810301","msmarco_passage_34_500649465","msmarco_passage_34_674678176","msmarco_passage_35_291362853","msmarco_passage_35_709884514","msmarco_passage_37_430525993","msmarco_passage_37_445723479","msmarco_passage_37_458936147","msmarco_passage_37_461768462","msmarco_passage_37_463869853","msmarco_passage_38_112715914","msmarco_passage_38_90311674","msmarco_passage_39_624601835","msmarco_passage_42_801851619","msmarco_passage_43_678777275","msmarco_passage_46_555901544","msmarco_passage_46_565578665","msmarco_passage_47_18481380","msmarco_passage_49_59399534","msmarco_passage_51_483612801","msmarco_passage_51_585016207","msmarco_passage_52_185649425","msmarco_passage_52_186964487","msmarco_passage_52_194381502","msmarco_passage_54_252908803","msmarco_passage_54_252909978","msmarco_passage_56_20853579","msmarco_passage_56_533104113","msmarco_passage_56_569043844","msmarco_passage_58_112175964","msmarco_passage_58_77932559","msmarco_passage_59_47551328","msmarco_passage_61_295052599","msmarco_passage_61_331046335","msmarco_passage_61_851268881","msmarco_passage_62_750363570","msmarco_passage_62_790610126","msmarco_passage_62_822733668","msmarco_passage_63_13457767","msmarco_passage_63_13463710","msmarco_passage_63_425384766","msmarco_passage_63_494401136","msmarco_passage_63_643059118","msmarco_passage_63_771575628","msmarco_passage_63_787066153"]}

This can occur when someone witnesses or is repeatedly exposed to traumatic events through their work or caregiving responsibilities, leading to symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and emotional numbing.\n\nThe concept of secondary trauma was first introduced by Dr. Judith Herman in her 1992 book \"Trauma and Recovery,\" where she described it as a form of \"secondhand\" trauma experienced by individuals who are not directly involved in the traumatic event. Since then, the term has been adopted across various fields, including psychology, social work, and healthcare, to describe this phenomenon.\n\nIt is essential to note that secondary trauma can be just as debilitating as primary trauma, and its effects can be long-lasting if left unaddressed.

However, home child care arrangements are subject to varying laws, regulations, and standards across different jurisdictions, and families should consult local authorities or childcare experts to ensure compliance with relevant requirements and best practices.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_528421598","msmarco_passage_00_601189579","msmarco_passage_00_702052494","msmarco_passage_00_705600918","msmarco_passage_00_712614298","msmarco_passage_00_826730292","msmarco_passage_01_778909268","msmarco_passage_02_383502920","msmarco_passage_04_808765135","msmarco_passage_05_128370379","msmarco_passage_05_462848252","msmarco_passage_05_462848718","msmarco_passage_05_462850126","msmarco_passage_05_462853144","msmarco_passage_05_462853621","msmarco_passage_05_462855012","msmarco_passage_05_547307441","msmarco_passage_05_547308976","msmarco_passage_05_547309366","msmarco_passage_05_837270536","msmarco_passage_05_837279310","msmarco_passage_05_837281732","msmarco_passage_05_837299337","msmarco_passage_06_357867398","msmarco_passage_07_83662008","msmarco_passage_08_649578042","msmarco_passage_08_712070760","msmarco_passage_08_712078079","msmarco_passage_09_680483316","msmarco_passage_13_442977820","msmarco_passage_13_462717445","msmarco_passage_13_462718325","msmarco_passage_13_483938301","msmarco_passage_13_70841252","msmarco_passage_14_330405629","msmarco_passage_14_330425575","msmarco_passage_14_534241922","msmarco_passage_14_545672620","msmarco_passage_14_553444766","msmarco_passage_14_553445521","msmarco_passage_14_848356340","msmarco_passage_14_848401339","msmarco_passage_14_848447738","msmarco_passage_14_848449104","msmarco_passage_14_848454767","msmarco_passage_14_848538097","msmarco_passage_17_155046684","msmarco_passage_17_45231772","msmarco_passage_17_89382120","msmarco_passage_17_89385538","msmarco_passage_18_353531355","msmarco_passage_18_353532189","msmarco_passage_24_558066186","msmarco_passage_24_558066532","msmarco_passage_24_558067027","msmarco_passage_24_558067947","msmarco_passage_25_549989380","msmarco_passage_25_549989855","msmarco_passage_25_549990343","msmarco_passage_26_5742700","msmarco_passage_26_5743260","msmarco_passage_26_580958009","msmarco_passage_26_580959003","msmarco_passage_29_226789104","msmarco_passage_29_226816366","msmarco_passage_29_226820148","msmarco_passage_29_251665665","msmarco_passage_29_251729445","msmarco_passage_29_26224846","msmarco_passage_32_349108044","msmarco_passage_32_416680068","msmarco_passage_36_421371160","msmarco_passage_37_9953585","msmarco_passage_38_616146189","msmarco_passage_39_810948838","msmarco_passage_40_721199974","msmarco_passage_41_148496956","msmarco_passage_41_185345572","msmarco_passage_41_185346021","msmarco_passage_41_427114885","msmarco_passage_41_427342965","msmarco_passage_41_427343374","msmarco_passage_42_194006497","msmarco_passage_43_116324768","msmarco_passage_43_116325180","msmarco_passage_43_116344960","msmarco_passage_43_116446093","msmarco_passage_43_116447900","msmarco_passage_43_116464578","msmarco_passage_43_116465259","msmarco_passage_43_116484178","msmarco_passage_43_126876285","msmarco_passage_43_353320329","msmarco_passage_43_354542899","msmarco_passage_44_469150545","msmarco_passage_50_609065303","msmarco_passage_51_53840596","msmarco_passage_52_121021593","msmarco_passage_52_131749454","msmarco_passage_53_238280024","msmarco_passage_54_127293295","msmarco_passage_54_55150227","msmarco_passage_54_681264757","msmarco_passage_55_163627063","msmarco_passage_55_542846342","msmarco_passage_55_740823044","msmarco_passage_55_740823463","msmarco_passage_56_458571488","msmarco_passage_56_458571833","msmarco_passage_56_503609463","msmarco_passage_57_564526578","msmarco_passage_57_564526987","msmarco_passage_62_802178442","msmarco_passage_64_448453974","msmarco_passage_66_11162916","msmarco_passage_66_14848396","msmarco_passage_66_14850843","msmarco_passage_66_14852491","msmarco_passage_66_22790106","msmarco_passage_68_825909082","msmarco_passage_68_827532841"]}

Typically, a good starting point is to take your toddler to the potty after waking up, after meals or snacks, before and after naps, and at least one more time in the day. Some toddlers may need to visit the potty every 30 minutes, while others may only require visits every hour. It's also common for toddlers to show interest and readiness signs at different times, such as squatting, showing discomfort with a soiled diaper, or expressing a desire to use the potty. Be prepared to adjust your routine frequently as your child grows and their needs change, and remember that consistency is key in establishing a successful potty training routine.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_25785083","msmarco_passage_00_810187564","msmarco_passage_01_222225972","msmarco_passage_01_222226445","msmarco_passage_01_252165237","msmarco_passage_01_827889043","msmarco_passage_01_827889462","msmarco_passage_04_371832166","msmarco_passage_04_769724033","msmarco_passage_07_538206223","msmarco_passage_08_23676824","msmarco_passage_08_426817540","msmarco_passage_08_710901987","msmarco_passage_08_711013681","msmarco_passage_08_711764753","msmarco_passage_08_715348922","msmarco_passage_09_145257942","msmarco_passage_10_824398151","msmarco_passage_11_641685826","msmarco_passage_11_776353886","msmarco_passage_11_92699134","msmarco_passage_12_731407336","msmarco_passage_12_731772444","msmarco_passage_14_849473764","msmarco_passage_15_383980972","msmarco_passage_15_821191589","msmarco_passage_16_711589632","msmarco_passage_17_323012693","msmarco_passage_24_255317839","msmarco_passage_25_129914442","msmarco_passage_25_129917627","msmarco_passage_25_129918525","msmarco_passage_26_715299121","msmarco_passage_28_216606712","msmarco_passage_28_467554196","msmarco_passage_29_467183497","msmarco_passage_30_227937764","msmarco_passage_32_207422950","msmarco_passage_32_299363537","msmarco_passage_32_299684579","msmarco_passage_32_355855477","msmarco_passage_33_554390298","msmarco_passage_34_10225733","msmarco_passage_34_10230881","msmarco_passage_34_190658023","msmarco_passage_34_8365504","msmarco_passage_35_813943355","msmarco_passage_36_738362339","msmarco_passage_37_651364989","msmarco_passage_37_651367103","msmarco_passage_38_608946385","msmarco_passage_38_608949497","msmarco_passage_40_2554511","msmarco_passage_41_309865806","msmarco_passage_42_793721323","msmarco_passage_44_777166397","msmarco_passage_48_743360049","msmarco_passage_48_744887695","msmarco_passage_51_566433525","msmarco_passage_51_566434791","msmarco_passage_55_809008765","msmarco_passage_55_809009186","msmarco_passage_56_504245110","msmarco_passage_56_504268981","msmarco_passage_56_80793084","msmarco_passage_59_412198308","msmarco_passage_59_412200605","msmarco_passage_62_764972914","msmarco_passage_64_365346544","msmarco_passage_66_19112748","msmarco_passage_66_19120532","msmarco_passage_66_19127634","msmarco_passage_66_22368476","msmarco_passage_66_4124599","msmarco_passage_67_235860272","msmarco_passage_67_395320413"]}

Prime has several areas where improvements can be made. One notable concern is the inconsistent delivery times, with some customers receiving their packages promptly while others wait for weeks or even months. This variability can lead to frustration and disappointment for those relying on timely deliveries.\n\nAnother issue lies in Amazon's treatment of third-party sellers, who often face strict regulations and limited support from the platform. This has led to concerns about product quality control, customer reviews manipulation, and unfair competition between sellers.\n\nFurthermore, Prime Members have reported issues with the service's additional benefits, such as Prime Music, which some find cluttered and difficult to navigate. The app's algorithm for suggesting new content can be overly reliant on user data, leading to an experience that feels tailored too closely to individual preferences rather than providing a diverse listening experience.\n\nAdditionally, many customers have expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency in Amazon's return policy, which can lead to lengthy and complicated refund processes. This has resulted in a negative impact on the overall Prime experience for some users.\n\nLastly, some critics argue that Prime has become overly commercialized, prioritizing advertising over user experience. The integration of ads into the Prime Video app, for example, can be distracting and detract from the intended viewing experience.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_178264270","msmarco_passage_01_773472964","msmarco_passage_03_262684133","msmarco_passage_04_739671198","msmarco_passage_05_240850758","msmarco_passage_11_868883658","msmarco_passage_12_368534109","msmarco_passage_12_375115138","msmarco_passage_12_375243235","msmarco_passage_12_378651213","msmarco_passage_12_383079131","msmarco_passage_12_389629255","msmarco_passage_12_389632776","msmarco_passage_12_394324751","msmarco_passage_13_717201423","msmarco_passage_16_136315333","msmarco_passage_22_415115752","msmarco_passage_23_221114761","msmarco_passage_25_122315013","msmarco_passage_25_722373627","msmarco_passage_25_729815770","msmarco_passage_25_729818131","msmarco_passage_28_711806292","msmarco_passage_30_385102107","msmarco_passage_30_402080041","msmarco_passage_31_101709342","msmarco_passage_31_101709780","msmarco_passage_31_101852780","msmarco_passage_31_818628146","msmarco_passage_32_1890292","msmarco_passage_32_339476077","msmarco_passage_32_503571298","msmarco_passage_32_864608812","msmarco_passage_33_309747617","msmarco_passage_33_319219682","msmarco_passage_33_431438109","msmarco_passage_33_686018990","msmarco_passage_33_700333002","msmarco_passage_33_708720807","msmarco_passage_33_748663312","msmarco_passage_33_757998835","msmarco_passage_33_81983231","msmarco_passage_33_81983803","msmarco_passage_33_81987607","msmarco_passage_33_81989503","msmarco_passage_33_81993952","msmarco_passage_33_82044797","msmarco_passage_33_82048529","msmarco_passage_34_169775892","msmarco_passage_34_173576023","msmarco_passage_34_173576587","msmarco_passage_34_173578315","msmarco_passage_34_173581132","msmarco_passage_34_174628852","msmarco_passage_34_226910050","msmarco_passage_34_301702931","msmarco_passage_35_203877476","msmarco_passage_35_696962280","msmarco_passage_35_696965144","msmarco_passage_35_696982774","msmarco_passage_35_696988872","msmarco_passage_35_696993785","msmarco_passage_35_697179600","msmarco_passage_35_697205510","msmarco_passage_36_341273052","msmarco_passage_36_341855138","msmarco_passage_36_341857042","msmarco_passage_36_342256008","msmarco_passage_36_348083086","msmarco_passage_37_110213590","msmarco_passage_37_113286731","msmarco_passage_37_699231161","msmarco_passage_39_261521480","msmarco_passage_39_261678906","msmarco_passage_40_358065505","msmarco_passage_41_321861418","msmarco_passage_41_695765678","msmarco_passage_43_567288598","msmarco_passage_43_567290473","msmarco_passage_43_567290908","msmarco_passage_43_619122024","msmarco_passage_44_220592899","msmarco_passage_45_776789779","msmarco_passage_46_249015561","msmarco_passage_46_530279629","msmarco_passage_47_174646416","msmarco_passage_47_415015948","msmarco_passage_47_480161557","msmarco_passage_47_480162038","msmarco_passage_47_536544168","msmarco_passage_47_536605616","msmarco_passage_48_107413176","msmarco_passage_48_107415321","msmarco_passage_48_107420605","msmarco_passage_49_599959057","msmarco_passage_49_599993611","msmarco_passage_49_624957679","msmarco_passage_49_624961085","msmarco_passage_50_381575181","msmarco_passage_51_142339884","msmarco_passage_51_220505865","msmarco_passage_51_241135804","msmarco_passage_52_435721106","msmarco_passage_52_435721580","msmarco_passage_52_435724234","msmarco_passage_52_435727409","msmarco_passage_52_435731332","msmarco_passage_52_435731787","msmarco_passage_52_435733066","msmarco_passage_52_435733542","msmarco_passage_52_435735768","msmarco_passage_52_436063205","msmarco_passage_52_440999167","msmarco_passage_53_43802726","msmarco_passage_54_167194237","msmarco_passage_54_167194913","msmarco_passage_54_168514543","msmarco_passage_54_172377118","msmarco_passage_54_172487507","msmarco_passage_54_83715552","msmarco_passage_55_773905152","msmarco_passage_56_149022165","msmarco_passage_56_518742730","msmarco_passage_56_619642492","msmarco_passage_56_620300096","msmarco_passage_57_557044962","msmarco_passage_57_770085662","msmarco_passage_57_770303636","msmarco_passage_58_57954044","msmarco_passage_59_159400948","msmarco_passage_59_265233611","msmarco_passage_59_272158394","msmarco_passage_59_744143614","msmarco_passage_61_776197913","msmarco_passage_62_284531005","msmarco_passage_62_291728497","msmarco_passage_62_411403645","msmarco_passage_62_418352014","msmarco_passage_62_418690773","msmarco_passage_64_391436148","msmarco_passage_64_59232081","msmarco_passage_65_268722296","msmarco_passage_66_205060737","msmarco_passage_66_325779598","msmarco_passage_66_329540606","msmarco_passage_66_329548361","msmarco_passage_66_736670817","msmarco_passage_66_747015849","msmarco_passage_67_632318493"]}

Mesquite trees can grow up to 30 feet tall with a broad canopy, while smaller varieties remain more compact. The plants have a deep taproot that allows them to access water deeper in the soil, enabling them to survive in areas with limited rainfall. Mesquite is often associated with cattle grazing and is valued for its hardwood timber and nutritious beans, which are used as animal feed. However, it's essential to note that not all mesquite plants belong to the same genus, and regional variations can lead to differing descriptions of this species.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_578628572","msmarco_passage_00_578633570","msmarco_passage_01_638738390","msmarco_passage_02_75442131","msmarco_passage_02_75444417","msmarco_passage_02_75444906","msmarco_passage_02_75445358","msmarco_passage_02_75445770","msmarco_passage_02_75446260","msmarco_passage_02_75446721","msmarco_passage_03_279380229","msmarco_passage_03_279389435","msmarco_passage_03_279395371","msmarco_passage_05_507166789","msmarco_passage_05_536169144","msmarco_passage_05_536176420","msmarco_passage_06_518438357","msmarco_passage_06_518439590","msmarco_passage_06_519675095","msmarco_passage_06_54723717","msmarco_passage_06_74528466","msmarco_passage_08_847428897","msmarco_passage_12_441426722","msmarco_passage_14_161430876","msmarco_passage_14_161431321","msmarco_passage_20_39644027","msmarco_passage_20_39645085","msmarco_passage_20_39651820","msmarco_passage_20_500749282","msmarco_passage_22_23019866","msmarco_passage_23_167062034","msmarco_passage_23_625466443","msmarco_passage_24_744427499","msmarco_passage_24_760081982","msmarco_passage_24_760082387","msmarco_passage_24_760083940","msmarco_passage_24_791870965","msmarco_passage_24_791871829","msmarco_passage_24_791872223","msmarco_passage_24_846253423","msmarco_passage_24_859045751","msmarco_passage_26_330293605","msmarco_passage_26_356426533","msmarco_passage_26_477439523","msmarco_passage_26_477440013","msmarco_passage_26_477441367","msmarco_passage_26_477442208","msmarco_passage_26_477443540","msmarco_passage_26_477443998","msmarco_passage_26_477444779","msmarco_passage_26_477445664","msmarco_passage_26_477447468","msmarco_passage_26_479107488","msmarco_passage_26_667230324","msmarco_passage_26_667230779","msmarco_passage_26_667238119","msmarco_passage_30_272383637","msmarco_passage_30_868293350","msmarco_passage_31_626109244","msmarco_passage_31_626109711","msmarco_passage_35_199859339","msmarco_passage_36_10560511","msmarco_passage_36_10563162","msmarco_passage_45_52242969","msmarco_passage_46_359050495","msmarco_passage_47_272711160","msmarco_passage_47_272711941","msmarco_passage_47_329628672","msmarco_passage_47_329629445","msmarco_passage_47_329633324","msmarco_passage_47_329633758","msmarco_passage_47_329635869","msmarco_passage_47_329649842","msmarco_passage_47_539170474","msmarco_passage_47_68849621","msmarco_passage_49_433547698","msmarco_passage_49_433548987","msmarco_passage_49_433550271","msmarco_passage_49_433550690","msmarco_passage_49_433556347","msmarco_passage_49_494700585","msmarco_passage_49_494701015","msmarco_passage_49_494702123","msmarco_passage_49_833365162","msmarco_passage_49_840677190","msmarco_passage_53_259348886","msmarco_passage_53_817245804","msmarco_passage_54_5272468","msmarco_passage_60_233877627","msmarco_passage_61_140192411","msmarco_passage_61_140192869","msmarco_passage_62_537284424","msmarco_passage_66_296926477","msmarco_passage_67_100993980","msmarco_passage_67_100995736"]}

A healthcare provider may prescribe a medication that needs to be taken orally, such as fluconazole, which is typically taken once daily for 7-14 days. Additionally, certain treatments, like probiotics and tea tree oil, have shown promise in reducing symptoms but are not recommended as primary treatment options.\n\nAppropriate diagnosis involves a physical exam by a healthcare provider, along with a review of medical history and laboratory tests, such as a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation test. Treatment should be tailored to the individual's specific condition, taking into account factors like age, overall health status, and any underlying medical conditions.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_480656792","msmarco_passage_00_62058122","msmarco_passage_00_98143220","msmarco_passage_01_368466628","msmarco_passage_01_368513656","msmarco_passage_01_368516728","msmarco_passage_01_368520011","msmarco_passage_01_829530191","msmarco_passage_03_769612428","msmarco_passage_04_788918042","msmarco_passage_05_37482202","msmarco_passage_05_704984104","msmarco_passage_05_777789236","msmarco_passage_06_132625075","msmarco_passage_06_735659851","msmarco_passage_06_755084176","msmarco_passage_06_771250932","msmarco_passage_06_780404116","msmarco_passage_07_121233815","msmarco_passage_07_32994504","msmarco_passage_07_32997172","msmarco_passage_07_638739018","msmarco_passage_07_713807325","msmarco_passage_08_20087650","msmarco_passage_08_364016120","msmarco_passage_08_39649072","msmarco_passage_08_54518698","msmarco_passage_08_683920539","msmarco_passage_08_836896022","msmarco_passage_09_458923547","msmarco_passage_10_800371621","msmarco_passage_14_476816179","msmarco_passage_14_477217682","msmarco_passage_16_431699746","msmarco_passage_19_42231951","msmarco_passage_21_453181971","msmarco_passage_22_174629112","msmarco_passage_22_256753463","msmarco_passage_24_140933497","msmarco_passage_24_142670851","msmarco_passage_24_185369082","msmarco_passage_24_26407109","msmarco_passage_24_512072971","msmarco_passage_24_91034561","msmarco_passage_25_612813381","msmarco_passage_26_397249703","msmarco_passage_35_789060606","msmarco_passage_37_71501779","msmarco_passage_37_771385658","msmarco_passage_38_431189523","msmarco_passage_40_265018471","msmarco_passage_40_360385046","msmarco_passage_40_416541501","msmarco_passage_42_792001855","msmarco_passage_42_832330956","msmarco_passage_43_360406190","msmarco_passage_43_560742253","msmarco_passage_44_461720843","msmarco_passage_44_70031103","msmarco_passage_45_191930044","msmarco_passage_45_617750885","msmarco_passage_45_617751400","msmarco_passage_48_523657201","msmarco_passage_48_523662618","msmarco_passage_48_523674460","msmarco_passage_48_523675346","msmarco_passage_48_60082379","msmarco_passage_48_724940001","msmarco_passage_48_759696171","msmarco_passage_48_777020208","msmarco_passage_48_819312668","msmarco_passage_48_866857792","msmarco_passage_49_400142866","msmarco_passage_50_638571393","msmarco_passage_53_528132177","msmarco_passage_53_593877836","msmarco_passage_53_848292842","msmarco_passage_54_498466120","msmarco_passage_54_506512915","msmarco_passage_55_315337444","msmarco_passage_57_184595029","msmarco_passage_57_409976831","msmarco_passage_57_547677932","msmarco_passage_58_816009491","msmarco_passage_60_482296020","msmarco_passage_60_503254839","msmarco_passage_60_503255303","msmarco_passage_60_503257433","msmarco_passage_60_503259482","msmarco_passage_60_503269461","msmarco_passage_60_503275560","msmarco_passage_60_503275915","msmarco_passage_60_503276847","msmarco_passage_60_503280584","msmarco_passage_61_525880240","msmarco_passage_61_525892796","msmarco_passage_64_660379147","msmarco_passage_64_676501036","msmarco_passage_65_811594280","msmarco_passage_65_858706130","msmarco_passage_65_858715295","msmarco_passage_66_161979729","msmarco_passage_66_555602858","msmarco_passage_66_79033545","msmarco_passage_68_15533051","msmarco_passage_68_314355962","msmarco_passage_68_314737411"]}

Let your partner know what behaviors are and aren't acceptable in your relationship. It's also crucial to maintain your own identity, independence, and autonomy.\n\nConsider seeking couples therapy or counseling together to work through underlying issues and develop healthier communication patterns.

The concept of externalities or surroundings can be seen as the environment or context that shapes our experience of a given entity, while the shape itself remains an internal construct.\n\nUltimately, the outside of a shape is subjective and depends on the context in which it is being considered \u2013 whether geometric, spatial, visual, or philosophical.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_7364289","msmarco_passage_02_141941524","msmarco_passage_03_178544845","msmarco_passage_04_157295509","msmarco_passage_04_180508276","msmarco_passage_04_224490661","msmarco_passage_04_224493219","msmarco_passage_04_421324755","msmarco_passage_04_421325189","msmarco_passage_04_440738341","msmarco_passage_07_856245154","msmarco_passage_08_230528722","msmarco_passage_09_100888389","msmarco_passage_09_499693814","msmarco_passage_10_805207095","msmarco_passage_13_116121692","msmarco_passage_14_380634127","msmarco_passage_14_383655025","msmarco_passage_14_386589262","msmarco_passage_14_386594011","msmarco_passage_14_386599418","msmarco_passage_14_386600216","msmarco_passage_14_389706344","msmarco_passage_15_594655726","msmarco_passage_15_68677213","msmarco_passage_22_207891540","msmarco_passage_26_127535410","msmarco_passage_26_194805494","msmarco_passage_26_194807137","msmarco_passage_27_194447232","msmarco_passage_29_373078247","msmarco_passage_30_274290600","msmarco_passage_30_791062627","msmarco_passage_30_795691752","msmarco_passage_30_795692746","msmarco_passage_31_597633190","msmarco_passage_31_617244749","msmarco_passage_31_617250318","msmarco_passage_31_617252440","msmarco_passage_32_157658184","msmarco_passage_35_227158998","msmarco_passage_35_227346629","msmarco_passage_37_336993290","msmarco_passage_38_864384414","msmarco_passage_38_865605035","msmarco_passage_39_2954803","msmarco_passage_42_369497884","msmarco_passage_42_770646755","msmarco_passage_42_770652305","msmarco_passage_42_770652713","msmarco_passage_44_777589835","msmarco_passage_50_478017292","msmarco_passage_50_479293983","msmarco_passage_51_551869105","msmarco_passage_51_552660113","msmarco_passage_51_581882937","msmarco_passage_51_581884426","msmarco_passage_51_696188893","msmarco_passage_52_763958495","msmarco_passage_53_285798352","msmarco_passage_53_294926604","msmarco_passage_53_294933503","msmarco_passage_53_294934426","msmarco_passage_53_294939316","msmarco_passage_54_345303230","msmarco_passage_54_345303676","msmarco_passage_54_345307163","msmarco_passage_56_105311151","msmarco_passage_57_113904185","msmarco_passage_60_545126173","msmarco_passage_61_137801919","msmarco_passage_61_137802657","msmarco_passage_61_255611944","msmarco_passage_61_255613957","msmarco_passage_61_322016997","msmarco_passage_61_322669577","msmarco_passage_61_322693702","msmarco_passage_61_322734764","msmarco_passage_61_322737678","msmarco_passage_61_322763626","msmarco_passage_61_322795512","msmarco_passage_61_322805305","msmarco_passage_64_191330761","msmarco_passage_64_469206542","msmarco_passage_65_728389331","msmarco_passage_65_728409697"]}

Additionally, a report by the Pew Research Center found that in 2020, nearly 2 million immigrants left the United States, with many citing economic or family reasons for their departure.\n\nSome of these migrants have been resettled in countries such as Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. However, it is essential to note that the correlation between Trump's policies and migration trends is complex and influenced by various factors, including historical context, economic conditions, and regional dynamics.\n\nIt is also worth noting that data on specific migrants fleeing the U.S. due to Trump's presidency is limited, as many countries do not release detailed information on the motivations behind individual migrations. As a result, it is challenging to pinpoint a direct causal link between Trump's policies and the migration of individuals from the United States.","dids":["msmarco_passage_03_318412849","msmarco_passage_07_263781379","msmarco_passage_07_263810671","msmarco_passage_07_297153196","msmarco_passage_14_858059306","msmarco_passage_41_122702426","msmarco_passage_49_279823158","msmarco_passage_58_130778680","msmarco_passage_61_684310362","msmarco_passage_63_615254845","msmarco_passage_64_74041063"]}

Understanding and addressing unresponsiveness can be crucial for resolving issues, improving performance, and maintaining overall well-being.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_104994010","msmarco_passage_00_547633597","msmarco_passage_00_758956165","msmarco_passage_01_497532509","msmarco_passage_02_230667230","msmarco_passage_04_633588018","msmarco_passage_07_769639350","msmarco_passage_08_103420634","msmarco_passage_08_103495376","msmarco_passage_08_128935683","msmarco_passage_08_264322249","msmarco_passage_08_467274725","msmarco_passage_08_716689952","msmarco_passage_09_345786353","msmarco_passage_10_156317556","msmarco_passage_11_398725107","msmarco_passage_11_398726015","msmarco_passage_11_472864585","msmarco_passage_11_727040479","msmarco_passage_12_235819657","msmarco_passage_12_437248674","msmarco_passage_14_107820198","msmarco_passage_16_856708563","msmarco_passage_17_810417193","msmarco_passage_20_385795996","msmarco_passage_21_51495631","msmarco_passage_21_51496235","msmarco_passage_22_466074514","msmarco_passage_22_466075029","msmarco_passage_22_466076283","msmarco_passage_27_524148596","msmarco_passage_31_313386492","msmarco_passage_33_261883571","msmarco_passage_35_484387073","msmarco_passage_35_484387957","msmarco_passage_35_484390942","msmarco_passage_35_788491849","msmarco_passage_38_287934804","msmarco_passage_38_287935169","msmarco_passage_38_395995513","msmarco_passage_38_422317669","msmarco_passage_39_830045861","msmarco_passage_40_625063664","msmarco_passage_40_749655255","msmarco_passage_41_257417125","msmarco_passage_42_130581303","msmarco_passage_43_475374815","msmarco_passage_44_12686993","msmarco_passage_44_295179211","msmarco_passage_45_172787121","msmarco_passage_45_213940769","msmarco_passage_46_138829018","msmarco_passage_46_139225952","msmarco_passage_46_139230610","msmarco_passage_46_442901680","msmarco_passage_46_443931200","msmarco_passage_48_764630934","msmarco_passage_49_73519829","msmarco_passage_53_748092823","msmarco_passage_53_760431935","msmarco_passage_53_844978253","msmarco_passage_55_451180157","msmarco_passage_55_695018524","msmarco_passage_58_363861628","msmarco_passage_58_363862662","msmarco_passage_58_366314690","msmarco_passage_58_424813518","msmarco_passage_58_424814301","msmarco_passage_58_424816028","msmarco_passage_58_424816921","msmarco_passage_58_424819143","msmarco_passage_58_424819642","msmarco_passage_58_424821090","msmarco_passage_58_424822014","msmarco_passage_58_424823312","msmarco_passage_60_481125510","msmarco_passage_60_485843745","msmarco_passage_60_485847153","msmarco_passage_62_102858495","msmarco_passage_62_498496801","msmarco_passage_63_262827350","msmarco_passage_64_303842406","msmarco_passage_66_1864910","msmarco_passage_66_297870709","msmarco_passage_66_297871967"]}

In general, \"duped\" refers to being deceived or misled into doing something or believing something that is false or misleading. For example, if someone is duped into buying a fake product, it means they were tricked into purchasing an item that isn't genuine.\n\nIn a different context, \"duped\" can also mean to be surprised or tricked by something unexpected. For instance, if you're expecting a certain outcome but get something entirely different, you might say someone has duped you into thinking otherwise.\n\nHowever, in some cases, particularly in the context of art or entertainment, \"duped\" is used as a verb, meaning to create an illusion by using trickery or deception. For example, a painter might be said to have duped an audience into believing a certain image is real when it's actually a clever fake.\n\nOverall, the meaning of \"duped\" depends on the context in which it's used, and understanding its nuances can help clarify its intended meaning.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_738764519","msmarco_passage_00_758740436","msmarco_passage_01_236166176","msmarco_passage_01_692217461","msmarco_passage_01_696509017","msmarco_passage_01_696510680","msmarco_passage_02_238443435","msmarco_passage_02_31791928","msmarco_passage_02_31795299","msmarco_passage_02_566962899","msmarco_passage_04_158682203","msmarco_passage_04_165293166","msmarco_passage_04_165294657","msmarco_passage_05_499312188","msmarco_passage_05_499312633","msmarco_passage_05_499313119","msmarco_passage_05_499313540","msmarco_passage_05_499314341","msmarco_passage_05_503416933","msmarco_passage_05_577038324","msmarco_passage_05_577042139","msmarco_passage_05_633132182","msmarco_passage_10_103877513","msmarco_passage_10_103878031","msmarco_passage_10_103881559","msmarco_passage_10_110008516","msmarco_passage_10_99934208","msmarco_passage_10_99934684","msmarco_passage_11_173175743","msmarco_passage_11_174335909","msmarco_passage_14_657172647","msmarco_passage_15_703264856","msmarco_passage_16_265635168","msmarco_passage_21_783819430","msmarco_passage_21_783819880","msmarco_passage_25_406314356","msmarco_passage_25_406415303","msmarco_passage_25_421549175","msmarco_passage_25_421557706","msmarco_passage_29_408866569","msmarco_passage_42_707667659","msmarco_passage_43_183183771","msmarco_passage_43_187235108","msmarco_passage_43_187239657","msmarco_passage_43_400488199","msmarco_passage_43_400489009","msmarco_passage_43_406015862","msmarco_passage_53_798438298","msmarco_passage_53_806588553","msmarco_passage_54_456896","msmarco_passage_54_789353239","msmarco_passage_62_32553823","msmarco_passage_63_114936993","msmarco_passage_63_138513048","msmarco_passage_63_138732175","msmarco_passage_63_138741199","msmarco_passage_63_138742474","msmarco_passage_63_152827377","msmarco_passage_63_152834473","msmarco_passage_63_258421340","msmarco_passage_68_109811520","msmarco_passage_68_109817895","msmarco_passage_68_110373692","msmarco_passage_68_60218052"]}

It can be used in various culinary applications due to its unique texture and flavor.\n\nOne popular way to prepare heart of palm is by substituting it for meat in dishes like steak salads or sandwiches. Slice the heart of palm thinly and marinate it in a mixture of olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice before grilling or saut\u00e9ing. This adds a tender, slightly sweet, and nutty flavor.\n\nHeart of palm can also be used as an ingredient in Asian-inspired stir-fries, where it pairs well with vegetables like bell peppers and onions. Stir-fry the sliced heart of palm with soy sauce, ginger, and garlic for added depth of flavor.\n\nFor a more elegant presentation, slice the heart of palm into thin rounds or wedges and serve as an appetizer. Garnish with fresh herbs, such as parsley or dill, and pair it with dips like hummus or guacamole.\n\nIn some Latin American cuisines, heart of palm is used in salads, soups, and stews, where its unique texture adds a pop of freshness. It can be boiled, steamed, or saut\u00e9ed to bring out its natural sweetness.","dids":["msmarco_passage_06_410823810","msmarco_passage_06_411583517","msmarco_passage_06_411584035","msmarco_passage_06_411584952","msmarco_passage_06_540397140","msmarco_passage_06_613672063","msmarco_passage_06_613672474","msmarco_passage_07_52515713","msmarco_passage_09_327559102","msmarco_passage_09_625916402","msmarco_passage_11_332412607","msmarco_passage_11_332414039","msmarco_passage_14_171919522","msmarco_passage_15_540623338","msmarco_passage_19_204577740","msmarco_passage_24_318569765","msmarco_passage_24_587618893","msmarco_passage_26_182590047","msmarco_passage_26_859877833","msmarco_passage_26_859879254","msmarco_passage_26_859882265","msmarco_passage_26_859883115","msmarco_passage_27_648365358","msmarco_passage_32_96170690","msmarco_passage_32_96171200","msmarco_passage_34_360343858","msmarco_passage_34_360345575","msmarco_passage_34_360345943","msmarco_passage_34_360346423","msmarco_passage_34_622091537","msmarco_passage_34_622096513","msmarco_passage_42_773602612","msmarco_passage_46_199324930","msmarco_passage_46_551622609","msmarco_passage_46_566766964","msmarco_passage_48_789501170","msmarco_passage_48_789501595","msmarco_passage_48_789502867","msmarco_passage_48_789503305","msmarco_passage_48_789503695","msmarco_passage_50_28047329","msmarco_passage_54_657229315","msmarco_passage_54_657231969","msmarco_passage_54_657232401","msmarco_passage_55_719640712","msmarco_passage_56_233769632","msmarco_passage_56_806558476","msmarco_passage_56_806558814","msmarco_passage_57_128221099","msmarco_passage_59_481403253","msmarco_passage_61_281333743","msmarco_passage_63_12654881","msmarco_passage_63_12656198","msmarco_passage_63_12657993","msmarco_passage_63_12658976","msmarco_passage_63_12662681","msmarco_passage_63_477065249","msmarco_passage_63_793669465","msmarco_passage_63_793669829","msmarco_passage_63_793671053","msmarco_passage_63_793671763","msmarco_passage_64_866352804","msmarco_passage_64_88980356","msmarco_passage_65_822946276","msmarco_passage_66_34641101","msmarco_passage_66_416535675","msmarco_passage_66_650285197","msmarco_passage_66_650288169","msmarco_passage_66_650288592","msmarco_passage_66_830480188","msmarco_passage_66_830481096","msmarco_passage_66_830483212","msmarco_passage_66_830484072","msmarco_passage_66_830484495","msmarco_passage_67_265349196","msmarco_passage_67_265350482","msmarco_passage_68_13870253"]}

From a practical perspective, \"now\" refers to the present moment, the current instant in time, often marked by the use of words such as \"at this very moment,\" \"right now,\" or \"presently.\" In this sense, now is a temporal anchor that serves as a reference point for measurement and experience.\n\nFrom a philosophical standpoint, the nature of now is more abstract. The concept has been explored in relation to the human experience of time, with different perspectives on whether it is a fundamental aspect of our reality or an illusion created by our perception. Some argue that now is a subjective experience, shaped by individual consciousness and memory, while others propose that it is an objective feature of the universe, governed by physical laws.\n\nObjective measurements of time, such as clocks and calendars, provide a temporal framework for understanding now in terms of duration, frequency, and sequence. However, these standards are human constructs, subject to revision and reinterpretation as our understanding of time evolves. Ultimately, the definition of now remains a dynamic and context-dependent concept that continues to be refined through ongoing debates and discoveries in fields such as physics, philosophy, and psychology.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_742108324","msmarco_passage_00_742108824","msmarco_passage_00_742109303","msmarco_passage_00_742112694","msmarco_passage_00_748741964","msmarco_passage_01_861344844","msmarco_passage_02_492062652","msmarco_passage_05_490328050","msmarco_passage_05_614623585","msmarco_passage_06_180635207","msmarco_passage_07_768670106","msmarco_passage_11_175079895","msmarco_passage_15_703288293","msmarco_passage_15_749147350","msmarco_passage_16_278620794","msmarco_passage_21_787580410","msmarco_passage_26_731477175","msmarco_passage_36_292371587","msmarco_passage_43_175354931","msmarco_passage_43_175355911","msmarco_passage_43_175358988","msmarco_passage_43_175996298","msmarco_passage_43_189268270","msmarco_passage_43_189268573","msmarco_passage_43_199247665","msmarco_passage_45_315249347","msmarco_passage_45_315303583","msmarco_passage_45_337277348","msmarco_passage_48_185639467","msmarco_passage_52_830658575","msmarco_passage_52_830690541","msmarco_passage_53_780388606","msmarco_passage_53_818330119","msmarco_passage_53_820895166","msmarco_passage_53_820897755","msmarco_passage_53_820898433","msmarco_passage_53_827201668","msmarco_passage_63_197226223","msmarco_passage_63_197227696","msmarco_passage_63_197228110","msmarco_passage_63_197231057","msmarco_passage_63_197235692","msmarco_passage_63_213315348","msmarco_passage_63_255731170","msmarco_passage_64_183332083","msmarco_passage_64_194350946","msmarco_passage_64_216948510","msmarco_passage_68_64430960","msmarco_passage_68_67304125"]}

Some key theories include Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which posits that intrinsic motivation is derived from autonomy, competence, and relatedness; Expectancy Theory, which suggests that motivation arises from the perceived connection between effort and reward; and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, which proposes a pyramid structure where basic physiological needs are fulfilled before higher-level psychological needs like esteem and self-actualization. Additionally, Social Learning Theory, proposed by Albert Bandura, suggests that behavior is learned through observation and reinforcement, while the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) theory proposes that job demands can either motivate or demotivate employees depending on their level of resources available. Other influential theories include McClelland's Acquired Needs Theory, which explains motivation based on three acquired needs: achievement, affiliation, and power; and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, which identifies two sets of hygiene factors (satisfiers and dissatisfiers) that influence job satisfaction. Despite these diverse approaches, there is no single authoritative source, and many theories intersect or conflict, underscoring the complexity of human motivation.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_254460613","msmarco_passage_02_823160780","msmarco_passage_02_823161789","msmarco_passage_03_159403250","msmarco_passage_03_173655069","msmarco_passage_03_775762331","msmarco_passage_06_151772759","msmarco_passage_07_86770528","msmarco_passage_08_410271490","msmarco_passage_08_695340495","msmarco_passage_09_712092393","msmarco_passage_09_723642883","msmarco_passage_09_88496974","msmarco_passage_11_164945566","msmarco_passage_13_448008656","msmarco_passage_13_448011539","msmarco_passage_13_450236154","msmarco_passage_13_450842058","msmarco_passage_13_476626446","msmarco_passage_13_476626949","msmarco_passage_13_476629046","msmarco_passage_13_484462697","msmarco_passage_14_345009965","msmarco_passage_15_292803475","msmarco_passage_15_546706746","msmarco_passage_15_577333696","msmarco_passage_15_577534694","msmarco_passage_15_581735192","msmarco_passage_18_461265266","msmarco_passage_18_591005081","msmarco_passage_18_730672448","msmarco_passage_18_778611457","msmarco_passage_19_508917099","msmarco_passage_20_604100275","msmarco_passage_21_589771875","msmarco_passage_22_135781478","msmarco_passage_22_135992176","msmarco_passage_22_136006037","msmarco_passage_22_136012688","msmarco_passage_22_148524084","msmarco_passage_23_22778975","msmarco_passage_23_572307775","msmarco_passage_23_604000635","msmarco_passage_25_428746603","msmarco_passage_25_720850256","msmarco_passage_26_197497660","msmarco_passage_26_199374322","msmarco_passage_29_158191135","msmarco_passage_29_182218559","msmarco_passage_29_189207710","msmarco_passage_29_194476797","msmarco_passage_29_368229895","msmarco_passage_30_216712803","msmarco_passage_30_216715125","msmarco_passage_30_216719452","msmarco_passage_30_218022882","msmarco_passage_30_541606778","msmarco_passage_30_626628367","msmarco_passage_30_681496658","msmarco_passage_30_684440175","msmarco_passage_30_698277178","msmarco_passage_30_710726156","msmarco_passage_30_717051650","msmarco_passage_30_779965393","msmarco_passage_31_160902136","msmarco_passage_32_155820158","msmarco_passage_32_343313282","msmarco_passage_32_345946565","msmarco_passage_33_125317950","msmarco_passage_33_180856074","msmarco_passage_34_401351414","msmarco_passage_35_295494437","msmarco_passage_37_392130073","msmarco_passage_38_225724630","msmarco_passage_40_368834692","msmarco_passage_40_381251430","msmarco_passage_41_664338627","msmarco_passage_41_664658666","msmarco_passage_42_585347644","msmarco_passage_44_842108483","msmarco_passage_45_203824572","msmarco_passage_45_575542144","msmarco_passage_46_770252451","msmarco_passage_48_445715743","msmarco_passage_50_165967360","msmarco_passage_50_166787540","msmarco_passage_50_831217618","msmarco_passage_51_572243167","msmarco_passage_51_810373382","msmarco_passage_53_258982993","msmarco_passage_53_265453338","msmarco_passage_53_77499179","msmarco_passage_53_81100291","msmarco_passage_55_677856889","msmarco_passage_57_665432732","msmarco_passage_57_677992687","msmarco_passage_59_60956805","msmarco_passage_59_61589378","msmarco_passage_60_218574589","msmarco_passage_65_113929317","msmarco_passage_65_823912702","msmarco_passage_65_853432108","msmarco_passage_66_148382172","msmarco_passage_68_624061960","msmarco_passage_68_624070769","msmarco_passage_69_63741530"]}

In the formulation stage, exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other airborne chemicals can occur due to mixing and blending. Workers may also be at risk of skin contact with raw materials such as solvents, resins, and pigments.\n\nAcute hazards associated with paint making include the handling of toxic substances like lead in pigments, mercury in fluorescent paints, or arsenic in some traditional pigments. Prolonged exposure to these substances can cause severe health issues, including neurological damage, kidney problems, and reproductive harm.\n\nChronic hazards, on the other hand, arise from long-term exposure to paint fumes, dust, and particles during production, application, and disposal. This can lead to respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung disease, as well as potential carcinogenic effects of certain chemicals present in paints.\n\nMoreover, improper waste management and disposal of paint scraps, rags, and contaminated materials can result in fires or explosions due to flammable solvents and volatile liquids. Additionally, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves, and goggles is crucial to prevent skin contact, inhalation, and eye irritation.\n\nOverall, making paint requires careful handling of hazardous materials, adherence to safety protocols, and proper disposal of waste to minimize exposure risks for workers in this industry.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_126708252","msmarco_passage_00_231008372","msmarco_passage_00_854092054","msmarco_passage_02_235133513","msmarco_passage_02_292062906","msmarco_passage_02_66751760","msmarco_passage_02_843441613","msmarco_passage_04_427140768","msmarco_passage_05_188795033","msmarco_passage_05_188795476","msmarco_passage_05_398666055","msmarco_passage_05_754330505","msmarco_passage_05_845603062","msmarco_passage_05_845604379","msmarco_passage_05_845604846","msmarco_passage_05_857317553","msmarco_passage_06_88320095","msmarco_passage_06_88321011","msmarco_passage_07_13470467","msmarco_passage_07_13472506","msmarco_passage_07_451141603","msmarco_passage_07_451144890","msmarco_passage_07_55951347","msmarco_passage_07_81665949","msmarco_passage_08_190296949","msmarco_passage_08_488957250","msmarco_passage_08_671815668","msmarco_passage_09_190430224","msmarco_passage_09_424247560","msmarco_passage_09_424248087","msmarco_passage_09_424249009","msmarco_passage_09_8221451","msmarco_passage_10_209612443","msmarco_passage_11_646285429","msmarco_passage_12_426863608","msmarco_passage_14_163321067","msmarco_passage_14_751281708","msmarco_passage_14_751285962","msmarco_passage_15_110402387","msmarco_passage_16_427748990","msmarco_passage_17_249511774","msmarco_passage_17_501499723","msmarco_passage_19_594979883","msmarco_passage_20_868194449","msmarco_passage_21_819613453","msmarco_passage_21_819679092","msmarco_passage_21_819679620","msmarco_passage_21_819680174","msmarco_passage_21_819680646","msmarco_passage_21_819902087","msmarco_passage_21_819985097","msmarco_passage_22_490740234","msmarco_passage_22_504757181","msmarco_passage_24_167096435","msmarco_passage_24_167097285","msmarco_passage_24_167097657","msmarco_passage_24_762692677","msmarco_passage_24_762694452","msmarco_passage_24_762695800","msmarco_passage_25_128071049","msmarco_passage_25_128636702","msmarco_passage_25_184496206","msmarco_passage_25_23555561","msmarco_passage_25_23566810","msmarco_passage_26_445572247","msmarco_passage_26_555428455","msmarco_passage_26_794554670","msmarco_passage_27_538718221","msmarco_passage_28_27021680","msmarco_passage_28_27373122","msmarco_passage_29_404635001","msmarco_passage_30_454678661","msmarco_passage_31_177201891","msmarco_passage_31_179220172","msmarco_passage_34_590841905","msmarco_passage_35_406107249","msmarco_passage_35_410852596","msmarco_passage_35_709050781","msmarco_passage_36_489195675","msmarco_passage_36_490861274","msmarco_passage_37_390287616","msmarco_passage_37_424294353","msmarco_passage_38_613461584","msmarco_passage_39_248251417","msmarco_passage_39_679407983","msmarco_passage_39_737853447","msmarco_passage_39_832584257","msmarco_passage_41_168496876","msmarco_passage_45_4330764","msmarco_passage_45_612388396","msmarco_passage_46_649112699","msmarco_passage_48_394034749","msmarco_passage_48_742812878","msmarco_passage_48_802284769","msmarco_passage_48_802285364","msmarco_passage_49_395236619","msmarco_passage_49_421437496","msmarco_passage_49_546677804","msmarco_passage_49_68649435","msmarco_passage_49_705189251","msmarco_passage_50_846575007","msmarco_passage_51_736901832","msmarco_passage_53_247311321","msmarco_passage_53_247374741","msmarco_passage_54_179830466","msmarco_passage_54_285473850","msmarco_passage_55_216481843","msmarco_passage_56_335762105","msmarco_passage_56_453514829","msmarco_passage_57_411062214","msmarco_passage_59_111164436","msmarco_passage_62_767489682","msmarco_passage_67_554097241","msmarco_passage_68_827709649"]}

small intestine (SI) is approximately 20 feet long and can be divided into three main regions: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. \n\n1. The duodenum, which is the first region of the small intestine, receives bile and pancreatic juices from the liver and pancreas, respectively. These enzymes help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body.\n\n2. The jejunum, which makes up about half of the total length of the small intestine, is primarily responsible for the absorption of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. It also plays a role in the absorption of vitamins B12 and D.\n\n3. The ileum, the final region of the small intestine, specializes in the absorption of bile salts and vitamin B12, as well as the reabsorption of water and electrolytes.","dids":["msmarco_passage_00_692083691","msmarco_passage_00_706840729","msmarco_passage_00_765443315","msmarco_passage_02_345774357","msmarco_passage_02_546609951","msmarco_passage_02_565877939","msmarco_passage_02_807971126","msmarco_passage_03_111744594","msmarco_passage_03_145208302","msmarco_passage_03_155748354","msmarco_passage_03_169215313","msmarco_passage_03_775700996","msmarco_passage_04_125507465","msmarco_passage_04_125969670","msmarco_passage_04_133589102","msmarco_passage_04_178149182","msmarco_passage_04_562094853","msmarco_passage_04_564784696","msmarco_passage_04_567896409","msmarco_passage_04_652288108","msmarco_passage_04_658441274","msmarco_passage_04_740131552","msmarco_passage_05_22170553","msmarco_passage_05_862141659","msmarco_passage_06_151432829","msmarco_passage_06_59830604","msmarco_passage_07_504630322","msmarco_passage_07_504630711","msmarco_passage_07_553108946","msmarco_passage_07_666390324","msmarco_passage_08_129386385","msmarco_passage_08_664004965","msmarco_passage_09_233083721","msmarco_passage_09_233084664","msmarco_passage_09_385908776","msmarco_passage_09_42973838","msmarco_passage_09_791340757","msmarco_passage_10_884071474","msmarco_passage_11_237824284","msmarco_passage_11_379413519","msmarco_passage_11_56611248","msmarco_passage_11_56672740","msmarco_passage_11_77898260","msmarco_passage_11_854705465","msmarco_passage_11_854705807","msmarco_passage_11_855416075","msmarco_passage_12_539976330","msmarco_passage_12_539991669","msmarco_passage_12_540333908","msmarco_passage_13_327308412","msmarco_passage_13_373239410","msmarco_passage_13_377184702","msmarco_passage_13_381927840","msmarco_passage_13_381928708","msmarco_passage_13_402164630","msmarco_passage_13_404485005","msmarco_passage_14_116358166","msmarco_passage_14_31519014","msmarco_passage_14_32006916","msmarco_passage_14_864501493","msmarco_passage_15_570365936","msmarco_passage_15_615264442","msmarco_passage_15_744168893","msmarco_passage_16_243815529","msmarco_passage_17_587879161","msmarco_passage_20_808642103","msmarco_passage_20_808642568","msmarco_passage_22_472406017","msmarco_passage_23_26058827","msmarco_passage_24_137075968","msmarco_passage_24_240568278","msmarco_passage_24_240573871","msmarco_passage_24_273566428","msmarco_passage_25_265791645","msmarco_passage_25_437298293","msmarco_passage_25_820527678","msmarco_passage_26_675461870","msmarco_passage_26_756854691","msmarco_passage_27_266633733","msmarco_passage_27_266638759","msmarco_passage_27_266639257","msmarco_passage_27_425590910","msmarco_passage_27_427020602","msmarco_passage_29_164144930","msmarco_passage_29_594798241","msmarco_passage_29_594798997","msmarco_passage_30_295730638","msmarco_passage_30_601635139","msmarco_passage_31_493489960","msmarco_passage_31_592953615","msmarco_passage_32_86375552","msmarco_passage_34_574446469","msmarco_passage_35_732265769","msmarco_passage_35_732271118","msmarco_passage_37_336357504","msmarco_passage_39_274537350","msmarco_passage_39_513732530","msmarco_passage_43_557818253","msmarco_passage_44_630383212","msmarco_passage_44_769776437","msmarco_passage_46_83447722","msmarco_passage_47_548504036","msmarco_passage_48_619243568","msmarco_passage_48_634224680","msmarco_passage_48_694004651","msmarco_passage_49_475264187","msmarco_passage_51_652579099","msmarco_passage_52_399702029","msmarco_passage_52_626352622","msmarco_passage_53_749177020","msmarco_passage_53_775970308","msmarco_passage_54_424570757","msmarco_passage_54_585431956","msmarco_passage_54_692360766","msmarco_passage_55_126884907","msmarco_passage_55_494746439","msmarco_passage_56_80532323","msmarco_passage_56_80534085","msmarco_passage_57_534667593","msmarco_passage_58_519387642","msmarco_passage_58_519444805","msmarco_passage_58_7522032","msmarco_passage_59_338045255","msmarco_passage_60_246299011","msmarco_passage_64_463097439","msmarco_passage_64_463104234","msmarco_passage_65_804707256","msmarco_passage_65_837785107","msmarco_passage_66_100465832","msmarco_passage_66_102095637","msmarco_passage_66_231334663","msmarco_passage_66_66032420"]}

Generally, personal property within the home, such as furniture, electronics, and appliances, are considered part of the real estate and may not automatically transfer to the new owner or go with the sale of the property.\n\nIn most cases, the proceeds from the foreclosure sale typically go towards paying off outstanding mortgages, liens, and other debts associated with the property. If there are any remaining funds, they might be distributed among multiple parties, including the lender, mortgage holders, and sometimes even the original owner.\n\nHowever, personal property can become part of the estate that is sold during the foreclosure process.

Other health conditions like kidney disease, diabetes, or sleep apnea can disrupt their normal sleeping patterns. Additionally, changes in the household, such as new pets, people, or furniture, can trigger anxiety.\n\nAge-related changes also play a significant role in feline behavior, with older cats often experiencing decreased muscle mass, reduced flexibility, and increased sensitivity to noise, leading to restlessness at night. Hormonal fluctuations during heat cycles or spaying\/neutering can cause anxiety and agitation. Environmental factors like loud noises, bright lights, or drafts can stimulate the cat's senses, making it difficult for them to relax.\n\nDietary changes, stress from travel, or separation anxiety can also contribute to restlessness at night. Factors such as a lack of mental stimulation, boredom, or overexertion during the day can carry into the evening and impact their ability to sleep soundly. It's essential to identify the underlying cause of your cat's restlessness and take steps to address it, whether through changes in their environment, diet, or providing additional attention and care.","dids":["msmarco_passage_01_264295065","msmarco_passage_01_812803051","msmarco_passage_04_67905575","msmarco_passage_04_790157614","msmarco_passage_04_790161102","msmarco_passage_08_195725317","msmarco_passage_08_797035147","msmarco_passage_10_541022175","msmarco_passage_11_693968644","msmarco_passage_11_693974437","msmarco_passage_11_693976238","msmarco_passage_11_693977214","msmarco_passage_12_164617453","msmarco_passage_14_639446476","msmarco_passage_14_666705606","msmarco_passage_14_666708586","msmarco_passage_16_731615484","msmarco_passage_22_107200033","msmarco_passage_22_336543860","msmarco_passage_22_336546512","msmarco_passage_29_381782084","msmarco_passage_29_742508499","msmarco_passage_29_743622309","msmarco_passage_29_756084053","msmarco_passage_38_25270538","msmarco_passage_38_308028109","msmarco_passage_38_308028927","msmarco_passage_40_625254685","msmarco_passage_54_16879462","msmarco_passage_54_592815473","msmarco_passage_56_810693066","msmarco_passage_56_810693542","msmarco_passage_56_811595734","msmarco_passage_56_824931367","msmarco_passage_56_839160991","msmarco_passage_56_843171803","msmarco_passage_57_501758179","msmarco_passage_57_5135158","msmarco_passage_57_777104726","msmarco_passage_60_389418709","msmarco_passage_60_390815456","msmarco_passage_64_627052968","msmarco_passage_66_162528410","msmarco_passage_67_344047776","msmarco_passage_67_396861742","msmarco_passage_67_458683358","msmarco_passage_67_464453591"]}

traveling to Europe, choosing the right phone can be a daunting task due to varying regional regulations, network compatibility differences, and roaming charge variations. To minimize disruptions, consider purchasing a local SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hotspot for data and calls. Alternatively, use your existing phone with an international plan that covers your destination countries. Look for phones compatible with European frequencies (GSM 900\/1800\/2100 MHz) and consider those from manufacturers like Samsung, Apple, or Google, which often have built-in roaming capabilities.\n\nIt's also essential to research the specific requirements for your destinations, as some countries may have different regulations or restrictions on phone usage.

The core component is a micro-dispersion lens array, comprising hundreds of individual lenses arranged in a specific pattern to correct for chromatic aberration and provide accurate perspective cues. This array is embedded within the \"retina display\" layer, which consists of a transparent OLED panel housing a stack of micro-lenses.\n\nA light guide layer, typically made of acrylic or polycarbonate, is sandwiched between two glass plates for structural support and optical clarity. The light guide layer directs and collimates the light from the micro-dispersion lens array to create a focused beam that illuminates the display area. This beam is achieved through a technique called \"lens-to-lens\" illumination, where each individual lens in the micro-dispersion array is illuminated by a precisely controlled amount of light.\n\nIn addition, Magic Leap's optics incorporate advanced waveguiding technology for efficient light transmission and minimal loss. The combination of these optical elements enables the creation of a see-through display that provides high-resolution images with accurate perspective cues while minimizing glare and reflections.","dids":["msmarco_passage_05_244287848","msmarco_passage_19_822051408","msmarco_passage_19_822054666","msmarco_passage_27_208160478","msmarco_passage_27_208160930","msmarco_passage_36_46118409","msmarco_passage_38_39451540"]}
