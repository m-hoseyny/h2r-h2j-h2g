It encompasses more than just the natural landscape; it includes the interactions between humans and their surroundings, including climate, terrain, flora, fauna, and the cultural and social systems that emerge from these interactions. Anthropologists view the environment as a dynamic and integral part of human existence, shaping patterns of subsistence, settlement, technology, and social organization. The concept of environment in anthropology is not static but rather a relational construct, emphasizing how human groups adapt to, modify, and are shaped by their ecological and cultural contexts. This holistic perspective underscores the interconnectedness of human societies with their environments, revealing how environmental factors influence cultural practices, beliefs, and worldviews across different societies and historical periods.","dids":["1720389","1720395","1729","2046505","3045565","3045567","3175481","3175484","527690","527692","527697","6452949","7122355","7320614","819168","8412681","8412682","8412683","8412684","8412685"]}

These terminal ends are responsible for transmitting signals to other neurons or target cells through a process called synaptic transmission. The synaptic knob contains synaptic vesicles, which store neurotransmitters\u2014chemical messengers that facilitate communication between neurons. When an action potential reaches the synaptic knob, it triggers the release of these neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, the small space between the axon terminal and the dendrites of the next neuron. This release allows the signal to be passed from one neuron to another, enabling the transmission of information throughout the nervous system.","dids":["1200258","1296110","1300989","1354790","1507610","1508658","1669816","1681331","1681332","1681334","1681335","1681336","1681337","1681339","1767240","1868437","1868438","1923153","1960681","2044900","2148997","2157582","2477210","2477211","2655670","2719555","2749477","2772864","284591","2917510","320920","3246976","3348837","3348838","3630933","3630935","3694265","3748434","3986046","4081982","4143232","4257346","4297620","4321228","4321230","4416477","4652795","4684891","4684893","4684895","473807","473809","4778734","4793758","4997370","5032362","5051722","5053382","5055000","5137402","5147527","5147529","5147530","525511","5417577","5417580","5417582","5949690","5966643","6111296","611271","618555","618556","618559","6191","6241147","6241148","6241150","6241151","6241152","6241153","6241154","6378779","6643066","6652175","6696631","6813699","6919836","7109642","7644552","766025","778272","7786719","7890942","7891160","7914826","8214977","829484","8327407","8327408","8348762","84017","8418681","8418684","8418686","8421421","8641104","8641107","8659158","8836262","913042","986177"]}

This condition is often a response to increased workload on the heart, particularly the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. The primary causes of LVH can be categorized into several key groups:\n\n1. **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):** The most common cause of LVH is long-standing hypertension. When blood pressure is consistently elevated, the left ventricle must work harder to pump blood against the resistance in the arteries. Over time, this increased workload causes the heart muscle to thicken and enlarge.\n\n2. **Aortic Stenosis:** A narrowing of the aortic valve restricts blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. To compensate, the left ventricle must generate more force to push blood through the narrowed valve, leading to muscle thickening and enlargement.\n\n3. **Athletic Training:** In some cases, particularly in athletes, LVH can be a normal adaptation to intense physical training. This type of LVH, known as \"athlete's heart,\" is generally benign and results from the heart's increased efficiency in pumping blood during exercise.\n\n4. **Genetic Disorders:** Certain inherited conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, can cause LVH. These conditions involve abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, often without an obvious cause, and can lead to impaired heart function.\n\n5. **Chronic Kidney Disease:** Impaired kidney function can lead to fluid retention and increased blood pressure, which in turn can contribute to LVH.\n\n6. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea:** This condition causes repeated pauses in breathing during sleep, leading to drops in oxygen levels and increased strain on the heart. Over time, this can result in LVH.\n\n7. **Other Cardiac Conditions:** Conditions such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), valvular heart disease, and certain arrhythmias can also contribute to LVH by altering the heart's workload and function.\n\nIn summary, LVH is primarily a compensatory response to increased workload on the left ventricle. While some causes, like hypertension and aortic stenosis, are pathological, others such as athletic training can be physiological. Early detection and management of underlying conditions are crucial in preventing the progression of LVH and its associated complications.","dids":["123547","1692902","1700168","1766470","1890715","1902826","1961300","2307974","2528294","2530227","2530252","2556144","2556150","2556151","2596279","2611818","2713030","2763490","2842948","2986227","3354162","3445699","4639455","4689523","4689524","4689525","47207","47208","47211","47212","4786305","5103077","5103083","5197135","5469038","5497677","5676026","5753301","6484575","6484576","6484578","6521360","6521366","6685092","6774305","6885718","7057928","7112964","7112968","7139898","7203296","742425","7526679","753721","7586365","7666828","7666831","8144448","8151919","8151921","8151922","8151926","8165401","8165404","8183982","8332546","8332547","8332551","8332555","8476330","8522403","8534130","8534134","8534135","8534136","8565420","8614360","8664069","8683178","8683181","8683183","8683185","8738510"]}

Several factors contribute to the risk of suicide among service members, including psychological, social, and environmental influences. One of the most significant causes is **post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, which can develop after exposure to combat, life-threatening situations, or traumatic events. PTSD is often associated with symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness, which can increase the risk of suicidal ideation.\n\nAnother critical factor is **military culture**, which can sometimes create an environment where seeking help is stigmatized. Service members may feel pressured to appear strong and resilient, making it difficult for them to reach out for mental health support. **Isolation and loneliness**, especially among deployed personnel, can also exacerbate mental health struggles.\n\n**Substance abuse** is another contributing factor, as it often co-occurs with mental health disorders and can lead to impaired judgment and increased risk-taking behaviors. Additionally, **combat exposure**, **redeployment stress**, and **family issues** such as marital problems or separation can all play a role in the development of suicidal thoughts.\n\n**Depression** is a leading cause of suicide in the general population, and it is particularly prevalent among military personnel. **Sleep disturbances**, **chronic pain**, and **physical injuries** from combat can also contribute to mental health decline and increase the likelihood of suicide.\n\nTo address these causes, the military has implemented various programs aimed at improving mental health care, reducing stigma, and providing support for service members in crisis. However, the issue remains a serious challenge that requires ongoing attention and intervention.","dids":["1294588","1395633","1697677","1697679","1770630","186931","186939","1890452","2026777","2052496","227211","2312984","2357235","2588902","2624886","2705839","2918391","3019505","3242437","3289965","4079788","4096633","4233763","4284131","4307936","4561062","4634899","4654326","4971349","5031929","5219890","5286924","5296736","5549020","5746165","5746167","5851090","6018160","6018163","6018164","6018165","6018166","6018168","6271635","6335465","6673729","6873071","7039125","7070552","7070558","7353355","7353359","7476937","7561798","7561800","7561801","7561803","7843984","7965004","7965007","7965011","8055174","8081937","8152222","8152225","8289253","8333912","8333916","8333917","8333919","8333920","8333921","8436576","8436578","8436579","8438483","8680815","8819111","8819112","8819114","8819116"]}

cost of interior concrete flooring can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the size of the space, the type of concrete used, the level of finish, and any additional treatments or customizations. On average, the cost of installing concrete flooring ranges from $4 to $12 per square foot. This price typically includes materials such as concrete, pigments, sealers, and labor for installation.\n\nFor a basic stamped or exposed aggregate concrete floor, you can expect to pay closer to the lower end of this range, around $4 to $7 per square foot. These options are often used in residential settings and offer a durable, low-maintenance surface. If you opt for a more intricate design, such as custom patterns, colored concrete, or decorative elements like inlays or textures, the cost can increase to $8 to $12 per square foot.\n\nAdditionally, the cost may also include surface preparation, which is essential for ensuring a smooth and long-lasting finish. In some cases, waterproofing or anti-slip treatments may be required, especially in areas like bathrooms or commercial spaces, which can add to the overall expense.\n\nOverall, while concrete flooring may have a higher initial cost compared to other flooring options, its durability, ease of maintenance, and aesthetic versatility often make it a cost-effective choice in the long run. It is always best to consult with a professional contractor to get an accurate estimate based on your specific project requirements.","dids":["1017092","1046334","1046339","1058524","120437","1275721","1304632","1313687","1357955","1357956","1357957","1357961","1424216","146169","146170","146171","146172","146173","146174","146175","146176","146177","1567102","1567107","1773805","1773807","1811410","1814642","1922603","1948963","1977801","1995989","2278231","2377050","2611066","2908924","2916631","298180","314919","3443173","3443176","3560539","3925933","4017854","4017855","4017856","4017858","4043623","409268","4230210","4230213","4350439","4452306","459675","459676","4717134","4819155","5073457","5138467","5138468","5138469","5138470","5138471","5138472","5138473","5138474","5138476","5150431","5248340","5248341","5248342","5248343","5248344","5394110","5483490","5652261","5652262","5652263","5652264","5652266","5662654","5667475","5688415","5688416","5688417","5688418","5688420","5688422","5688423","5703400","5703401","5801822","5836442","5864689","5864693","5864695","599604","599606","6056676","6187055","6241791","6241793","629270","629274","629276","629277","629278","6351571","6467577","6467578","6467579","6467580","6467581","6467583","6585554","6585562","6653674","6653675","6653677","6653678","6653679","6658615","6704672","6904992","715676","7204477","7302612","7506026","7506027","7506028","7506029","8056409","8056411","8138536","8349574","8495099","8546158","8546159","8546160","8546162","8748173"]}

It is typically used to resolve uncertainties regarding the meaning or application of a law, regulation, or contract. This type of judgment is often sought when there is a potential for future legal action or when a party seeks clarity on their legal standing. Declaratory judgments are commonly used in cases involving constitutional questions, regulatory compliance, or contractual interpretation. While they do not impose penalties or require enforcement, they provide a definitive legal statement that can guide future actions and decisions. This judicial process helps prevent litigation by offering a resolution to ambiguous legal situations before any actual harm or dispute arises.","dids":["1110766","1494930","1494931","1494932","1494935","1494936","1494938","1494939","2982053","3995677","4022904","6183638","6486232","6815300","7125239","7501558","7501560","7501563","799647","8514425","8612902","8612903","8612904","8612906","8612909","8612910","996732","996740"]}

The McDouble is a signature item from McDonald's, featuring two beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions, all served on a sesame seed bun. It is known for its consistent quality and flavor, tailored to meet McDonald's global standards.\n\nOn the other hand, a Double Cheeseburger is a more general term that refers to a burger with two beef patties and cheese, typically served on a regular bun. Unlike the McDouble, the Double Cheeseburger is not a standardized product and can vary significantly depending on the restaurant or region. It may include different types of cheese, additional toppings, or variations in the patty size and seasoning.\n\nIn summary, the McDouble is a specific, standardized burger from McDonald's, while a Double Cheeseburger is a broader category of burgers with two patties and cheese, often with more flexibility in ingredients and preparation.","dids":["1230566","1841197","4214923","4214925","4741857","4777144","4777148","6015024","6015026","6430258","6430259","6430260","7405002","744165","76348","8434618","8434619","8434620","8434622","8434623","8434624","8434625","8434626"]}

This can be achieved through various educational paths, including a diploma program, an associate degree in nursing (ADN), or a BSN. RNs are qualified to provide direct patient care in a variety of settings such as hospitals, clinics, schools, and long-term care facilities.\n\nOn the other hand, a BSN is a four-year undergraduate degree that provides a more comprehensive education in nursing, including courses in leadership, research, community health, and public policy. While earning a BSN does not automatically make someone an RN, it is a common pathway to becoming one. In fact, many BSN programs include clinical experiences and prepare students to take the NCLEX-RN exam to become licensed RNs.\n\nIn summary, a BSN is an academic degree, while an RN is a professional designation. A BSN can lead to an RN license, but not all RNs have a BSN. The BSN offers a broader educational foundation, which can lead to advanced career opportunities, including roles in management, education, and specialized nursing fields.","dids":["1299824","1299830","1311202","1311204","1311209","1314489","1384441","1384442","1384446","1384447","1384448","1392973","1392974","1495660","153920","1559002","1573498","1736918","1807279","1816663","1828165","1828170","1950974","1950975","1950976","1950977","1950980","1969518","1969519","1985491","1985494","231452","231453","231455","245019","2455774","2455776","2643562","2713526","2915322","2915323","2915327","3165111","3310962","332400","332401","3701822","3918785","3918787","3989976","4185812","4185814","4264121","4264127","4264128","4271667","4282153","4447598","4447601","4634425","4902096","4976411","5010072","5020788","5077705","512199","5171603","5601322","5679983","581145","5843047","615407","6434592","6485504","6536612","6697437","6704661","6889357","6894608","7407803","7407811","7407812","7496116","7529434","753805","7599536","7696389","791676","811946","8139872","8283528","8283530","8283531","8283532","8730434","8835172","958231","985490","985492","985493","985494"]}

goldfish do grow, but their growth is not indefinite and is influenced by several factors including their environment, diet, and genetics. When goldfish are first purchased, they are typically small, often around 1 to 2 inches in length. As they age, they can grow significantly larger, with some varieties reaching lengths of up to 12 inches or more, depending on the species and living conditions.\n\nGoldfish grow most rapidly during their first few months of life, and their growth rate tends to slow as they mature. Proper care, including a spacious tank, balanced nutrition, and good water quality, can help support healthy growth. However, it's important to note that goldfish are not fully mature until they are about one to two years old, and their growth potential is largely determined by their breed and the conditions in which they are kept.\n\nIn captivity, goldfish can live for many years, and with proper care, they can continue to grow throughout their lives, though at a much slower rate as they age. It's crucial to provide them with an environment that allows for their full growth potential while ensuring their well-being.","dids":["1034435","1101607","1277720","1277721","1277722","1277723","1277724","1277725","1277726","1277727","1277728","1347264","1347266","1420608","1861640","1861642","1960254","1960255","1960256","1960257","1960259","1960260","1960261","2123395","2236388","2259179","2259180","2259182","2259183","2317800","2317802","2317807","2317808","2403232","2411918","2598786","2598787","2612486","2612490","2612491","2612492","2612493","26129","2616512","2708304","2717163","2717165","2928700","2928702","2928704","2928705","2928706","2928707","2949801","2949802","316872","3288595","3288596","3288597","3288598","3288599","3288600","3288601","3288603","349638","349641","349643","349645","3603920","3603922","3603923","4131138","4369922","4527706","4542584","4583221","4940228","4940230","4940234","5009743","5022725","5346660","5437919","5506858","5530082","5555919","5752572","6139382","6139383","6139386","6139387","6357270","6524746","6775071","6983821","7055262","7055263","7104323","7371077","7371078","7371079","7431316","750111","8029433","8182159","8182160","8182161","8182162","8182165","8182166","8245444","8266017","8273011","8273013","8273015","8273017","8273019","8393766","8725855","8803136","8820525","8820526","885944","911794","95512","95513","95514","95515","95517","95518","95519","95521","994486"]}

*Legionella pneumophila* is a bacterium that can cause pneumonia, specifically a type known as **legionellosis** or **Legionnaires' disease**. This form of pneumonia is particularly severe and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. *Legionella pneumophila* is commonly found in freshwater environments and can colonize man-made water systems such as cooling towers, hot tubs, and plumbing systems. When these bacteria are aerosolized\u2014meaning they become suspended in the air\u2014they can be inhaled into the lungs, where they multiply and cause infection. \n\nOnce inside the lungs, *L. pneumophila* can lead to inflammation and fluid buildup, resulting in symptoms such as high fever, chills, cough, and difficulty breathing. In some cases, the infection may progress to severe respiratory distress. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, and early diagnosis is crucial to improving outcomes. While not all individuals infected with *Legionella* will develop pneumonia, those with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions are at higher risk for severe illness.","dids":["1090088","1090089","1183703","1183706","119130","1274194","1301465","1301466","1301467","1301468","1301469","1301470","1301471","1301472","1301473","1301474","13499","1381477","141221","1677027","1735358","1735360","1832002","1860841","1860843","1860844","1860848","1924796","1924800","1974321","1982106","2036279","2036283","2069988","2069992","2069995","2210772","2210773","2210774","2210775","2210778","2210780","2265769","2265772","2444467","2611845","2659074","2735305","2774854","2774855","2774860","2774862","2790904","2806307","290826","3004214","3033359","3034378","3096688","3174840","3198680","3198681","3198682","3198683","3198684","3198685","3198686","3198687","3198689","3342536","3344828","3344830","3344832","3344833","3344834","3344835","3344837","3399712","3399713","3399714","3399715","3399716","3399717","3399718","3399719","3399720","3401389","3415208","3463552","3463555","3463556","3507767","3556745","3670943","3670949","3681093","3681094","3681095","3681096","3681097","3681098","3681099","3681100","3790896","3830857","3908773","3908774","3908775","3908776","3908777","3908778","3908779","3908780","3908781","4119829","4160802","4191388","4191389","4191391","4191395","4191396","4215276","4243074","4245217","4245218","4245219","4324487","4324491","4324492","4324493","4329739","4493882","4498419","4498423","4600607","4600608","4600609","4600610","4656291","4656297","4741403","4741406","4792582","4792583","4918399","4938900","5004346","5024306","5024307","5024309","5024311","5024313","504720","504725","5050210","5114458","527409","5293614","5298477","5298481","5298483","5298484","5314644","5346757","5370224","5657932","5690224","5771045","5880511","5935473","5935474","5935476","5935477","5935479","6012597","6012598","6012600","6061717","6061718","6061719","6061720","6061721","6061722","6061723","6061724","6061725","6061726","6172551","6213322","6213323","6213324","6213325","6213326","6214542","6219117","6219118","6219119","6219121","6219122","6249512","6264729","6264730","6264731","6264732","6264733","6264734","6264735","6282560","6282561","6282562","6282564","6282567","6329932","6426630","6426631","6426632","6426633","6426634","6426635","6426636","6426637","6426638","6457806","6548726","6584042","661750","661757","6643451","6786380","6817965","689769","6989580","6996835","7049039","731200","7337513","7337518","7337519","7492748","7492752","7492753","7492754","7492755","7492756","7595680","7595682","7595684","7745780","8048968","8048969","8048973","8141128","8185129","8185131","8185134","8185135","8185137","8252757","8252758","8252759","8252761","8252762","8252763","8252764","8319214","8319215","8319216","8319218","8320715","8400578","851276","856274","8627333","8639627","8639630","8639633","8723467","8731617","8731618","8731620","8731621","8731622","8731623","8731624","8731625","8743646","8766386","8766387","8766391"]}

In other words, a monotonic function preserves the order of its input values. There are two types of monotonic functions: **non-decreasing** (increasing or constant) and **non-increasing** (decreasing or constant).\n\nFor example, consider the function **f(x) = 2x**. As the value of **x** increases, the value of **f(x)** also increases. This function is **monotonic increasing** because it never decreases. Similarly, the function **f(x) = -x** is **monotonic decreasing**, as the value of **f(x)** decreases as **x** increases.\n\nAnother common example is the function **f(x) = x\u00b3** for **x \u2265 0**. For all non-negative values of **x**, this function is strictly increasing, making it a monotonic function. However, if we consider the entire real line, **x\u00b3** is still monotonic because it never decreases\u2014it either increases or remains constant (though in this case, it never remains constant).\n\nMonotonic functions are important in mathematics and computer science, especially in areas like optimization, calculus, and algorithm design, where maintaining order or consistency is crucial.","dids":["1307234","1307235","1638687","1638689","1638690","2092202","2909954","2909960","2909961","3760957","3883077","3883081","4730803","5567729","5567732","5701365","57443","57444","57447","57448","57449","57452","6037973","6570493","6783449","6816571","6816572","6816573","6816574","6816579","6957819","6957823","6980965","7371255","7371257","7371259","7371261","7371262","738025","7583024","8299659","8299661","8299665","8299668","8515182","8598792","8757178","8757179","8757180","8757181","8757182","8757183","8757184"]}

biology, **exons** are the segments of a gene that are retained in the final mRNA molecule and are translated into protein. Genes are composed of both exonic and intronic regions; while exons contain the coding information necessary for protein synthesis, introns are non-coding sequences that are removed during a process called **RNA splicing**. During transcription, the DNA is copied into a pre-mRNA molecule that includes both exons and introns. Before the mRNA can be used to direct protein synthesis, the introns are excised, and the exons are joined together in a process that ensures the correct reading frame for translation. This splicing process is essential for generating functional mRNA and, in some cases, allows for the production of multiple protein variants from a single gene through a mechanism known as **alternative splicing**. Exons, therefore, play a fundamental role in the expression of genetic information and the diversity of proteins in organisms.","dids":["1087366","1127571","1239964","1239966","1247358","1289489","1289490","1289493","1289495","1289496","1289497","1555656","1561158","1566057","1605672","1605768","1678834","1730044","1730858","1750227","1773958","1773959","1854176","1908513","192535","1960310","2046681","206299","2095235","2095237","2234245","2234247","229739","2352713","2352716","2403808","2403811","2493332","2499861","2499865","2533256","2533260","2533262","2574033","2593965","2644128","2644131","2644132","2644601","26660","2874543","3009378","3093214","3093215","3093217","3093218","3093220","3119899","3128361","3128362","3156614","3185607","3185611","327908","327909","327913","327914","3377749","3389578","3389579","3389580","3389581","3389582","3389584","3389585","349581","349585","3561703","3578563","371475","3719076","3854211","3854428","3867601","3867604","3888461","3909768","3922973","3928768","3953758","3953760","3987911","4034821","4089637","4134894","4134895","4134896","4134897","4134899","4134901","4134902","4285002","4285004","448707","4493913","4493914","4493915","4493916","4493917","4493918","4493919","4493920","4493921","4493922","4512308","4727412","4727416","4727417","4727418","4727419","4803847","4803848","4803850","4803855","4803856","4856305","4977773","5026678","5026680","5088210","5098266","5260515","5260519","5318552","5335533","5391353","5391354","5452480","5460936","5460939","5460941","5486284","5534703","5534707","5534710","5534711","5760906","5798333","5798338","5817926","5817927","5867680","5867683","5867685","5899214","6109460","6109461","6114693","6185861","6220736","6247404","6247405","6291380","6533300","6548233","6548235","6626236","6788947","6788949","6879259","7045994","7128532","7398706","7448291","7449743","7449744","7449747","7449748","7449750","7449751","7449752","749539","749540","749542","749544","749547","749548","7677968","7677975","7678696","7703397","7718047","7718054","7734209","7811888","7920165","7952869","8006512","8121375","8121377","8192307","823211","8260787","8381280","8485658","8567665","8567669","8570255","8570256","8570257","8570258","8570260","8570261","8570263","8575895","8577215","8598372","8767239","8767240","8767241","8794302","8794303","8794304","8794306","8794307","8794308","914900","914901","950480"]}

This ability, known as \"endothermy,\" is relatively rare among marine animals and is most commonly observed in certain species of sharks, such as the great white shark (*Carcharodon carcharias*) and the hammerhead shark (*Sphyrna* spp.). \n\nUnlike most fish, which are cold-blooded and rely on the temperature of their environment, these sharks have specialized adaptations that allow them to maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. One key feature is a network of blood vessels in their muscles and liver that helps retain and generate heat. This system, sometimes referred to as a \"countercurrent heat exchange,\" works by allowing warm blood from the core of the body to flow through vessels close to the cooler blood returning from the gills, thereby minimizing heat loss.\n\nAdditionally, some sharks have a specialized muscle structure that generates heat through metabolic activity. This internal heat production enables them to remain active and efficient hunters even in colder waters.

life cycle of a flea is a complex process that typically takes between 14 to 30 days under ideal conditions, though it can vary depending on environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. The cycle begins when a female flea lays eggs, which can number in the hundreds. These eggs are laid on the host or in the environment, and they hatch into larvae after about 5 to 10 days. The larvae feed on organic matter, such as dried blood, feces, and skin debris, and go through three developmental stages before pupating. The pupal stage is enclosed in a cocoon, and during this time, the flea undergoes metamorphosis to become an adult. Once mature, the adult flea emerges from the cocoon and seeks a host to feed on blood, thus completing the life cycle. If the environment is favorable, the cycle can repeat rapidly, making fleas a persistent and challenging pest to control.","dids":["1240266","1444286","1610706","1610707","1610709","1610710","1610711","1610714","1611215","1611221","1702969","1702972","1804644","2089031","2164136","2223171","2420367","2472895","2474340","2474341","2474342","2474346","2498165","2498169","2572557","2616296","2689662","2810700","331928","331929","331931","331932","331934","331936","3338821","3338822","3338825","3338826","3338827","3338828","3362112","3372501","3389744","3396076","3577338","3577340","3577341","3577342","3577343","3577344","3577345","3577347","3601328","3601329","3601331","3601332","3601333","3601334","3601337","3666583","3666584","3683674","3720137","3835935","3841908","3841909","3841910","4016008","4016011","4016017","4043723","4126497","4239608","4239612","4259227","4367667","447992","4539746","4641917","4647186","4687213","4710717","4825862","4825863","4834543","4834544","4834546","4834547","4834548","5151339","5269173","528372","528373","528375","528376","528377","528378","528379","528380","528381","5324946","5324948","5328095","552765","5583424","5583426","5611210","5611211","5611212","5611213","5611214","5611215","5611216","5611217","5611218","5611219","5635514","5635515","5635516","5635517","5635518","5635519","5635520","5635521","5635522","5635523","5672391","5688727","5688730","5780490","5780498","5819142","58384","58385","58386","58387","5849267","5849268","5849270","5849271","5849272","5849274","5849711","5950718","5950719","5950720","5950721","5950722","5950723","5950724","5950726","6105566","6105567","6105568","6105569","6105571","6105572","6198294","6198295","6333839","6333841","6334964","6413944","6413950","6413951","6501719","6555321","6555322","6641238","6641241","6773914","6773920","6791755","6791757","6791760","684616","684618","684621","684622","7323462","7323463","7323466","7323467","7323468","7323470","7323471","7326932","7326933","7326934","7326936","7809272","8012101","8012103","8332127","8502491","8555145","8608903","8608908","8760488","8801656","8801661","935825","96851","96852","96853","96854","96855","96856","96857","96858","96859"]}

The midsegment is the segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides, or legs, of the trapezoid. This segment is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases.\n\nTo calculate the length of the midsegment, use the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Midsegment length} = \\frac{\\text{Base}_1 + \\text{Base}_2}{2}\n$$\n\nTo find the midsegment geometrically, you can locate the midpoints of the legs. One way to do this is by measuring the length of each leg and finding the midpoint by dividing the length by two. Then, draw a line segment connecting these two midpoints. This line segment is the midsegment of the trapezoid.\n\nAlternatively, you can use coordinate geometry. If the trapezoid is placed on a coordinate plane, find the coordinates of the midpoints of the legs by averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the endpoints of each leg. Then, connect these midpoints to form the midsegment.\n\nIn summary, the midsegment of a trapezoid is a line segment connecting the midpoints of the legs, and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases. This concept is useful in various geometric applications, including calculating areas and understanding the properties of trapezoids.","dids":["1394085","1394087","15799","15807","1830512","1830516","1830517","205472","2293818","2293820","2434861","2826510","2826511","2826512","2826513","3176544","3176546","3193824","3223831","3223833","3900185","4013723","4020470","4020477","4344098","4344101","457673","4624153","5345720","5547389","5615181","5615187","576628","576629","5773714","5806106","6031049","6108721","6834175","68647","68648","68649","68653","6873860","7062669","7062671","7579883","8058867","8058868","8058873","8167111","8167114","8456698","8811558","943229","943235"]}

defines mechanical ventilation as the use of a machine to assist or replace spontaneous breathing in individuals who are unable to breathe adequately on their own. This intervention is typically used in patients with severe respiratory failure, where the lungs are unable to provide sufficient oxygen to the body or remove carbon dioxide effectively. Mechanical ventilation may be provided through various methods, including a ventilator connected to a tracheal tube (intubation) or a non-invasive device such as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) machine. Medicare covers mechanical ventilation when it is medically necessary to support the patient's breathing and is provided in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or other approved care setting. The coverage may include the rental or purchase of the ventilator equipment, as well as related supplies and services.","dids":["103181","1078132","1078134","1094131","1094132","1094139","1096342","1211642","1211643","1211647","124065","1251646","1277290","1345709","1373769","1487899","1542548","1554231","1580615","1868905","1897978","1897981","2031662","2065190","2084909","2133671","2142558","2176455","2176459","2231589","2329895","23565","2383971","2414919","2486936","264875","264876","264881","2671181","2796545","2922141","2922142","2922147","2922148","3090667","3177691","3509960","3602215","362771","362780","3781323","3781331","3790251","384317","4061142","4176454","4233760","4352596","4352597","4352600","436291","4380277","4453605","4467811","4495080","4578310","4798722","4798729","4863797","4863800","4874640","4874642","4874643","4874644","5008865","508601","5122675","5179251","5241633","5320781","5451777","5538936","5538938","5538942","5655693","5661134","5915191","601510","6149891","6158710","6171396","6286973","6286974","6286975","6286976","6286977","6286978","6286979","6286980","6286981","6286982","631383","6587791","6618756","6618758","6618763","6697737","678179","6824692","6824695","6827517","6942418","6942790","7127634","7172679","7179468","7179473","7232293","7232295","7315074","7428020","7444911","7558643","7574511","7693252","7800959","7800962","7859334","7871479","8047626","8214451","8214452","8281322","8295161","8382005","8383461","8383462","8383463","8390518","8390519","8390521","8390525","8434177","8434178","8434180","847210","8595356","8621776","8621779","8621784","930490","930493","96222","96229"]}

Common causes include:\n\n1. **Ovarian Cysts**: Fluid-filled sacs that form on or inside the ovaries can cause pain, especially if they rupture or twist. This is more common in women of reproductive age.\n\n2. **Endometriosis**: A condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, often in the pelvic area. It can cause chronic pain, especially during menstruation or intercourse.\n\n3. **PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease)**: An infection of the female reproductive organs, often caused by sexually transmitted infections, can lead to inflammation and pain in the pelvis.\n\n4. **Ureteral Colic**: Pain from a stone in the right ureter, which can radiate from the flank to the lower abdomen or groin, may be mistaken for pelvic pain.\n\n5. **Appendicitis**: Although more commonly associated with lower right abdominal pain, appendicitis can sometimes present with pelvic discomfort, especially in the early stages.\n\n6. **Hernias**: A hernia in the groin or pelvic area can cause discomfort or pain, especially when lifting or straining.\n\n7. **Bladder or Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**: Infections can cause pain in the lower abdomen or pelvic area, often accompanied by frequent urination or a burning sensation.\n\n8. **Muscle Strain or Injury**: Overexertion, sports activities, or improper lifting can strain the muscles in the pelvic region, leading to localized pain.\n\n9. **Gynecological Conditions**: Conditions such as fibroids, adenomyosis, or ovarian torsion can also cause right pelvic pain.\n\n10. **Gastrointestinal Issues**: In some cases, issues like constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or gallbladder problems can cause referred pain to the right pelvic area.\n\nIt is important to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis, as right pelvic pain can indicate a serious condition that requires prompt treatment. A thorough physical examination, imaging, and possibly lab tests may be needed to identify the exact cause.","dids":["1051494","1051498","1090435","1114410","1231674","1231678","1383251","1430550","1431271","1479542","1513820","152948","1557550","1664640","1664643","1778458","1820199","1820203","187571","1905740","216492","2445205","2645311","2899721","3049941","320071","320073","320076","320079","3310420","3353678","3353685","3438217","34400","3710413","3980122","415420","4159098","4159416","4222521","4538296","4574496","4586570","4662177","5005765","5143975","5156386","518994","5513331","5541646","5640841","5640844","5640846","5640849","5815957","5842850","5856565","5856566","5856571","5895917","6087666","6327175","6435264","6581779","6620077","6727272","6816322","6879782","7037597","7064814","7112941","7113153","7113309","7134737","7134742","759508","759509","759510","7652972","769136","7815337","8047853","827173","827174","852250","852257","855963","8585820","8594272","872471","8737046","8737047","8737051","8773552","883663","889060"]}

It is named after its inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. RSA is a type of public-key cryptography, which means it uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors. The key generation process involves selecting two large prime numbers, computing their product, and then using these numbers to create the public and private keys. RSA is commonly used in various applications such as secure email, digital signatures, and secure web browsing.","dids":["1160847","1473259","1652460","1814180","1894652","1929910","1929911","2850740","3595607","3833407","3833410","3937195","3937197","3937200","3937202","3937203","3948082","4082316","4082319","4737059","4737060","4737061","4737063","4737064","4737065","4737066","4737067","4737068","4763066","4842889","4842890","4842891","4842894","4842895","4842896","4842897","5112294","5149754","5247992","5247999","5248000","526093","549465","5633631","6412650","6742119","6976960","7698199","7704024","805046","805047","805048","805051","8485139","8485141"]}

In individuals with cerebral palsy (CP), dysarthria can occur due to the brain damage that affects motor control, leading to impaired coordination and muscle tone. There are several types of dysarthria associated with cerebral palsy, each characterized by distinct patterns of speech impairment.\n\nOne common type is **spastic dysarthria**, which is associated with spastic cerebral palsy. This type involves stiffness and tightness in the muscles of the face, mouth, and throat, leading to speech that is slow, strained, and difficult to understand. The voice may be hoarse or monotone, and the person may have difficulty with articulation and prosody (the rhythm and intonation of speech).\n\nAnother type is **flaccid dysarthria**, which is more commonly seen in individuals with athetoid or dyskinetic cerebral palsy. This form of dysarthria results from weak and floppy muscles, leading to speech that is soft, breathy, and often slurred. The person may have difficulty maintaining consistent volume and pitch, and their speech may be inconsistent from one moment to the next.\n\n**Ataxic dysarthria** is another type that can occur in cerebral palsy, particularly in individuals with ataxic cerebral palsy. This type is characterized by poor coordination of the speech muscles, leading to speech that is slow, irregular, and often has a \"stuttering\" quality. The person may have difficulty with the timing and rhythm of speech, and their words may be slurred or unclear.\n\nIn addition to these types, **mixed dysarthria** can also occur, where symptoms of more than one type are present. This is common in individuals with complex cerebral palsy who have involvement of multiple motor control areas of the brain.\n\nEach type of dysarthria can significantly impact communication, and speech therapy is often a crucial part of the management plan. Therapists may use various techniques, such as oral motor exercises, speech pacing, and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, to help individuals with cerebral palsy improve their speech clarity and overall communication abilities.","dids":["1000485","1212778","1212782","1212784","1212786","1379237","1379239","1379240","1379242","1379245","1404580","1664518","1664523","2045580","2649533","269430","288675","2931562","3224403","3224404","3425595","3425601","3425604","3774355","3774357","3774358","3827084","3835729","3835731","3973284","3973285","3973286","3973287","3973290","4064455","452715","4952129","4952135","5034544","5034546","542050","5466805","5466807","5466810","5603298","6015376","6038411","6065675","6065678","6065681","6186391","6215001","6215002","6398043","6667277","6889396","7105525","7105531","7226291","7357591","7607669","7607672","7787755","7799466","7904112","8306449","8362259","8371764","8615714","8617271","8617274","8737880","8827928","890536","975967"]}

These conditions are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at the global, national, and local levels. They have a significant impact on health outcomes and are the primary factors that determine differences in health between and within countries.\n\nKey social determinants of health include socioeconomic status, education, employment and working conditions, social support networks, access to healthcare services, neighborhood and physical environment, and the availability of healthy food. For example, individuals living in poverty are more likely to experience poor health due to limited access to nutritious food, safe housing, and quality healthcare. Similarly, people with lower levels of education may lack the knowledge or resources to make healthy lifestyle choices.\n\nThese determinants often interact in complex ways, reinforcing health inequalities. Addressing social determinants of health is essential for achieving health equity, which means ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to attain their full health potential, regardless of their social background or circumstances. Policymakers, healthcare providers, and communities must work together to create environments that promote health and reduce the impact of these determinants on vulnerable populations.","dids":["1005338","104856","1165129","1509940","1509942","1816038","2002448","2021252","2133806","2819390","3059586","3059589","3146238","3365631","3365633","3365635","3365636","3365638","3365639","3937080","394136","394138","394139","394141","394142","4017883","41433","5047796","5310530","5339620","5721829","5721831","5962420","5962423","5962428","613337","6776717","6789025","7104825","7104826","7104827","7199667","7199669","7199672","7199673","7199674","7199675","7384329","7384332","7384333","7589690","7609927","7609928","7609930","7609932","7674858","7674859","7964601","8047166","8272972","8441642","8444730","8530902","87400","87404","87405","8833192","8833194","8833199"]}

This method works particularly well with proteins such as steak, chicken, salmon, and shrimp, as the controlled heat ensures even cooking without overcooking. Vegetables like asparagus, zucchini, and carrots can also be cooked sous vide to retain their color, texture, and nutrients. For those looking to experiment, sous vide is ideal for preparing delicate items such as eggs, where it can produce perfectly cooked, runny yolks with a tender white. Additionally, it is suitable for cooking whole roasts, such as pork or beef, and even for making creamy sauces and reductions. Desserts like custards and fruit compotes can also be prepared sous vide to achieve smooth, consistent textures. With the right equipment and techniques, almost any food can be cooked sous vide, offering a unique way to enhance flavor, texture, and presentation.","dids":["1396705","1396708","1605506","1815965","1907207","1972028","210379","210384","2588143","275724","275726","275728","275732","2923493","2923494","2923496","2923497","2923498","2923501","3357360","3385968","3385971","3485337","3538160","3538161","3538163","3538167","3538168","3573478","4044822","4279298","4566818","4566822","4656722","4834226","4910037","4998398","5117497","5774013","5774014","5931262","5931263","5931264","5931265","5931266","5931267","5931268","5931269","5931270","5931271","6142152","6181638","6226401","6521993","6761347","6923052","7313730","7313733","7709320","7816726","7832420","7861747","7861748","7861749","7861750","7861751","7861753","7861755","7861756","7885529","8002846","8002850","8002851","8002853","8002854","8002855","8029524","8029527","8029530","8029531","8029533","8103065","8103066","8103067","82106","82107","82108","82110","82113","8402971","8402972","8455300"]}

Born in 1792 in Boston, Massachusetts, Gray was the son of a shipbuilder and grew up with a deep connection to the sea. He began his career as a sailor at a young age and eventually became a licensed captain in the maritime fur trade, which was a lucrative industry at the time.\n\nIn 1811, Gray embarked on a voyage to the Pacific Northwest, where he became one of the first Europeans to explore the Columbia River. His expedition, which included the ship *Columbia Rediviva*, led to the discovery of the mouth of the river and the establishment of a trading post at Fort Vancouver. Gray's journey was instrumental in opening up the region to further European exploration and settlement.\n\nGray's most notable achievement was his 1812 expedition to the Oregon Territory, where he mapped the coastline and established contact with indigenous peoples. His detailed journals and maps provided valuable information for future explorers and settlers. Despite facing challenges such as harsh weather, limited supplies, and conflicts with indigenous communities, Gray's perseverance and skill earned him recognition as a pioneer in the field of exploration.\n\nRobert Gray died in 1858, but his legacy endures in the history of American exploration. The Columbia River and the city of Vancouver, Washington, are named in his honor, reflecting the lasting impact of his contributions to the exploration of the Pacific Northwest.","dids":["3167284","3387556","3641634","3641640","4095286","4974552","5438881","6060285","720665","7466652","7822415","8537479","8760871"]}

United States' decision to enter World War I in 1917 was the result of a complex interplay of political, economic, and strategic factors. Initially, the U.S. had maintained a policy of neutrality, as President Woodrow Wilson believed that the country should remain impartial in the conflict between the Allied Powers and the Central Powers. However, several key events and pressures gradually shifted American public opinion and government policy toward involvement.\n\nOne of the most significant factors was Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917. This policy allowed German submarines to attack Allied merchant ships without warning, leading to the sinking of American vessels such as the *Lusitania* in 1915. The sinking of the *USS Maine* in 1898 had already fueled American anti-German sentiment, and the continued attacks on American ships in 1917 intensified calls for retaliation.\n\nAdditionally, the Zimmermann Telegram, intercepted by British intelligence in early 1917, revealed a German proposal to incite Mexico to join the war against the United States. This telegram further outraged American public opinion and provided a direct perceived threat to national security.\n\nEconomic ties with the Allies also played a role. American businesses had invested heavily in European markets, and the war had disrupted trade. The U.S. provided significant financial and material support to the Allies, which created a sense of obligation and solidarity.\n\nFinally, President Wilson's vision of making the world \"safe for democracy\" and his desire to shape the post-war order through the League of Nations influenced the decision to enter the war. While Wilson's idealism was a factor, the immediate catalysts were Germany's aggressive actions and the growing pressure from both public opinion and political leaders.\n\nThus, the United States entered World War I in April 1917 as a response to Germany's threats to American interests, the sinking of American ships, the Zimmermann Telegram, and the broader context of global conflict and national security concerns.","dids":["1048074","1074552","1086039","1086043","1098172","1098177","1124053","1124058","1191942","1191945","12258","12260","12261","12264","12266","1248663","1423677","1523261","1523265","1523266","1580961","1585089","16693","1697238","1866482","1866485","1866486","1922586","1922590","1923499","1923506","2075189","2091261","2220585","2230089","2230090","2230095","2243178","2391455","2391456","2391457","2391460","2399255","2399257","2402110","2470328","2479413","2496764","2496767","2551914","2569813","2569816","2569817","2578724","2653693","2679612","2728074","2728076","2728077","2768117","2768120","2768123","2768426","2784782","2784784","2951510","2975474","3078268","3078272","309311","309313","309315","3095450","3098299","3132972","3132980","3134988","3134992","3134994","3192369","3192413","3192421","3259884","3259887","3259889","3259890","3259891","3259892","3268883","330159","330165","3327045","3327047","3327049","3327052","3334065","3376182","3376183","3394536","3394537","3484001","3484002","3503271","3516677","3610440","3610442","3610444","3610445","3610446","3654233","3654234","3654235","3654236","3672921","3676183","3676185","3802479","3802485","3802487","3802488","3871549","3965096","3973418","3973423","4066863","4080384","4100037","4158204","4158206","4193159","4310511","4310512","4337526","4337527","4337528","4337529","4337532","4341365","4487115","4487118","4541453","45591","4559127","4559128","4559130","45592","4594376","4594377","4594382","4681092","4681094","4712113","4712119","4718159","4718161","4802035","4802036","4834969","4834974","4914009","5006969","5006973","5115489","5115490","5120823","5138673","5138680","5166434","5204904","5287968","5311939","5311940","5360356","5360360","5360361","5412858","5416787","5423930","5423931","5424172","5442711","5442713","5442715","5442718","5452779","5519516","5657603","5766337","5766345","584334","5956099","5956102","5956106","6127382","6127385","6127389","621539","621544","6232574","6331478","6331481","6341347","6347199","6347200","6347205","6347206","6347207","6465909","6465910","6465912","6572590","6572591","6599404","6666444","6666451","6673653","684828","6987647","7122836","7122842","7146775","7146776","7146777","7146780","7146781","7146782","7247262","7247263","7247264","7247268","7571423","7571424","7571428","759813","7742956","7778354","7791760","7791761","7837936","7837938","7857767","7862343","7862344","7882525","7952964","7952965","7952966","7952967","7952969","7952971","7959124","8170637","8170638","8170640","8183810","819283","819284","8194910","8239876","8239877","8384973","8384975","8384979","8640242","8658912","8658915","8658918","8669866","8697948","8722081","8821734","8821735","8821736","8821738","8821739","973371"]}

The initiative was primarily led by the leaders of the five largest Soviet successor states: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. These nations sought to create a loose political and economic union to facilitate cooperation, maintain stability, and manage the transition from Soviet rule to independent states. The CIS was established as a voluntary association of sovereign states, with its headquarters in Minsk, Belarus. Its creation marked a significant step in the geopolitical reorganization of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, allowing former Soviet states to maintain some level of collective identity and mutual support while pursuing individual national interests.","dids":["1315739","1614303","1659850","1659852","2165733","2332189","2750960","2750961","2945096","3708772","3773618","3843263","3843267","3843270","3940091","4292848","4401695","5581839","5581840","6289840","7753287","8049013","8157968","8220081","8220085","8220086","8220087","8220088","8220089","8224183","8293805"]}

In a more general sense, \"visceral\" is often used to describe feelings or reactions that are deeply felt, instinctive, or rooted in the body rather than the mind. For example, a visceral response to a scary situation might be a sudden feeling of dread or a physical reaction like a racing heart. This usage highlights the connection between the body's internal processes and emotional experiences, emphasizing that some reactions are not just mental but also deeply physical in nature.","dids":["1020463","1334328","1334330","1334331","1334334","1334335","1334336","1342527","1601160","1905163","1905166","2002045","2430920","2464375","2513609","2672601","2672608","272753","272761","2827493","2866630","293370","2960561","2960563","2960564","2960566","3470705","4173709","4787149","4787153","4787157","5204536","5204538","5716681","5774818","5780391","6032859","7500585","7500586","7500587","7685380","7685382","7685385","7685388","7797163","7797167","788333","8199520","8199524","8204457","8204462","8204463","8204464","8502783","8521673","8596078","8685446","8685453","954035","954040"]}

Wi-Fi, short for Wireless Fidelity, is a technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other over a local network. It uses radio waves in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands to transmit data at high speeds, making it ideal for streaming videos, online gaming, and large file transfers. Wi-Fi is typically used in homes, offices, and public spaces to provide internet access to smartphones, laptops, smart TVs, and other devices.\n\nBluetooth, on the other hand, is a wireless technology designed for short-range communication between devices, usually within a range of about 30 feet. It operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band as well but is optimized for low-power, low-data-rate connections. Bluetooth is commonly used to connect peripherals like wireless headphones, speakers, keyboards, and mice to smartphones or computers. It is also used in devices such as fitness trackers and smartwatches to sync data with phones.\n\nIn summary, Wi-Fi is used for high-speed internet connectivity over a larger area, while Bluetooth is used for low-speed, short-range connections between devices. Both technologies are essential in modern life, but they are designed for different tasks and use cases.","dids":["1321205","1732296","1901875","1901876","1901877","1901878","1901879","1901881","1901882","239444","2796199","2811563","3110637","3838638","3838645","4053650","4053652","4504233","4511137","4511144","5049363","5172684","5218014","5857921","6368887","6368891","7221366","8160518","8160519","8160520","8160521","8160522","8160524","8160527","8301971"]}

In the morning, many Thais start their day with a cup of Thai coffee or a traditional *cha yen* (sweetened black tea), often enjoyed with a snack like *khao tom* (rice noodles) or *khao kha moo* (rice with pork). Families typically gather for breakfast, and many people head to work or school shortly after.\n\nIn urban centers like Bangkok, traffic can be a daily challenge, with bustling streets, motorbikes, and tuk-tuks weaving through the crowds. Many Thais work in a variety of sectors, including business, education, tourism, and technology. Despite the fast pace, there is a strong emphasis on community and family life. Lunch is often a time for relaxation, with many people taking a break from work to enjoy a meal with colleagues or family.\n\nAfternoon activities can vary widely\u2014some may take a nap, while others might visit a local market, attend a religious ceremony at a Buddhist temple, or engage in social activities. The Thai work culture is known for its balance between professional and personal life, with many people taking time off for festivals and holidays.\n\nThai festivals, such as Songkran (the Water Festival) and Loy Krathong, are major events that bring people together in celebration. These occasions are marked by unique traditions, such as showering each other with water during Songkran or floating lanterns on water during Loy Krathong.\n\nIn the evening, many Thais enjoy a relaxed time, often spending time with family or friends. Dinner is usually a hearty meal, and many people end their day with a visit to a local market, a movie, or a casual gathering. Whether in a bustling city or a quiet village, the daily life of a Thai person reflects a harmonious blend of tradition, spirituality, and a deep appreciation for life's simple pleasures.","dids":["1035060","1035061","1035062","1035063","1035064","1035065","1035066","1035067","1035068","1228458","1253945","1253952","1267515","1267516","1267517","1267518","1267519","1267520","1369480","1369482","1373646","1373648","1702898","1702902","1707313","1707314","1707315","1707316","1707317","1707318","1707319","1707321","1998330","1998331","1998332","1998333","1998335","1998338","2155567","2173822","2468291","2468292","2468293","2468295","2468296","2468297","2468298","2468299","2468300","2596431","2596432","263958","2694630","2694631","2694632","2694635","2694636","2735215","2735219","2860744","2860747","2860749","2925770","2936512","2936513","3016394","3041083","3352255","3352256","3408231","3408235","345581","345585","3490001","355109","355114","355115","355117","355118","3552356","3670747","3670748","3670750","3670754","3670756","3795887","4102529","4161482","4416071","4416076","4566122","4566125","4595993","4595995","4595999","4704992","4977768","5043409","5133283","5133287","5133288","5192037","6102033","6164791","6303182","6303183","6303184","6303186","6303187","6311795","6311799","6311801","6342847","6726340","6726344","6947370","7088035","7088036","7088037","7088039","7088041","7373078","7373085","7516467","7615749","7708629","7714607","7752460","8134789","8134793","8134796","8134797","8139249","8139251","8139252","8139255","8139256","8139257","8139258","8442178","8606160","917582"]}

Physically, spruce trees are typically tall and slender, with a straight, conical shape that allows them to thrive in a variety of environments. Their bark is generally thin and scaly, ranging in color from gray to reddish-brown, and it tends to flake off in small, irregular pieces. \n\nThe needles of a spruce are sharp and pointed, usually measuring between 0.5 to 2 inches in length. They are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, often with two white or gray stomatal lines visible on the lower side. These needles are attached to the branches in a compact arrangement, giving the tree a dense, feathery appearance.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of spruce trees is their cone, which is typically cylindrical and has a pointed tip. The cones are usually smaller than those of other conifers, and they remain attached to the branches for several years before falling. Spruces also have a unique branching pattern, with branches growing in a whorled or spiraled arrangement, contributing to their elegant and symmetrical shape.\n\nOverall, the physical description of a spruce tree includes its tall, slender form, scaly bark, sharp needles, and distinctive cones, all of which contribute to its recognizable appearance in forested landscapes.","dids":["1066532","1280565","1411655","1454812","1454814","1681783","1681785","1768727","2001933","2001934","2001935","2001936","2226349","2884191","3026984","3125150","3125152","3125154","3125155","351824","351827","3518300","3685677","3687620","3687624","3880944","4016933","4016937","4016938","4367828","4367832","4498864","4751835","4751839","5188747","5514592","5546284","5546286","5546287","5546288","5781995","5863434","5996691","6021902","6174327","6174328","6174329","631949","6597538","6688843","6688846","7368427","7377270","7377271","7377272","7377274","7377275","7377277","7377278","7385216","7385217","7385219","7385221","7385222","742037","742044","7497491","7497492","7497495","7890531","8128790","8128794","8128796","8503446","8503453","8566591","8729216"]}

It is commonly used to manage outbreaks of genital herpes, which is caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and can also be used for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which typically causes oral herpes. \n\nFamvir works by inhibiting the replication of the herpes virus in the body, which helps reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks. It is often prescribed for individuals who experience frequent or recurrent herpes infections. In addition to treating active outbreaks, Famvir may also be used for suppression therapy to prevent recurrent episodes, especially in people with frequent recurrences or those who are immunocompromised.\n\nIt is important to note that Famvir does not cure herpes, but it can significantly alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others. As with any medication, Famvir should be taken under the guidance of a healthcare provider, and patients should follow the prescribed dosage and duration to ensure effectiveness and minimize the risk of side effects.","dids":["1316103","1316109","1544838","1884059","1913368","2201127","2647994","266552","2676807","2695353","2911035","2911039","2911450","3056368","3177805","3184850","3861594","4332918","444374","444375","444377","444380","444382","5041692","5279567","5417949","5417952","5417953","5417954","5417956","5569142","5640859","5687477","579554","5836029","5959593","6348309","6704400","6711103","687064","7196956","771368","8117087","8117090","8117091","8117092","8117094","8117096","8327369","857788","857789","8665820"]}

These analysts work within banks, financial institutions, and other regulated entities to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements designed to combat financial crime.\n\nThe primary responsibility of an AML Surveillance Analyst is to monitor and analyze financial transactions for suspicious activity. They use advanced software tools and data analytics to review large volumes of transactional data, looking for patterns, anomalies, or behaviors that may indicate illegal activity. This includes identifying unusual transaction frequencies, large cash movements, or transactions that deviate from a customer's typical behavior.\n\nIn addition to transaction analysis, AML Surveillance Analysts also conduct customer due diligence (CDD), verify the identity of customers, and assess the risk profiles of individuals and entities. They may also be involved in the creation and maintenance of watchlists, which are databases of individuals or organizations known to be associated with criminal activities.\n\nWhen suspicious activity is detected, the analyst prepares detailed reports and alerts the appropriate internal teams, such as compliance officers or law enforcement, for further investigation. They also collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure that the institution remains in compliance with evolving AML regulations and industry standards.\n\nOverall, the role of an AML Surveillance Analyst is essential in maintaining the integrity of the financial system and preventing the misuse of financial services for criminal purposes.","dids":["1729572","2364285","3203281","3469357","4131485","4314169","4314170","4314172","4314173","4314174","4314175","4314176","5264931","5483597","5790943","5900622","6989198","8065457","8106317","8106318","8106321","8106324","8495250","8495256"]}

These margins are typically found along the edges of oceanic and continental plates, where one plate is subducting beneath another. This process, known as subduction, leads to the formation of deep ocean trenches, volcanic arcs, and mountain ranges. Active margins are often associated with intense seismic and volcanic activity, making them geologically dynamic and hazardous regions. Examples of active margins include the western coast of South America, the Pacific Ring of Fire, and the eastern coast of Asia. These areas are continuously shaped by the forces of plate tectonics, resulting in a constantly changing landscape.","dids":["1389420","1440192","1445087","1565783","1652329","1682790","1687526","1798612","1798614","1798619","1798620","2058940","2153481","2153487","2504563","2515909","2579691","2605637","2790381","2790382","2790384","317868","334611","334615","3349609","3349612","3398083","3412243","3435986","3440615","3543106","3607850","3780997","3781003","3859042","3906412","3951178","4059509","4393946","4393950","4393951","4441319","4441325","444196","4458506","4458509","4458510","4458512","4573811","458682","4698655","4775947","4789127","4886519","5032726","518714","52516","52519","52523","5258462","5286536","5286538","5286539","5299235","5596485","563625","6057206","6057207","6069016","6106022","6122720","6122721","6122722","6122723","6122724","6156360","6177939","6177941","6428299","6428300","6491820","6505419","6505420","651006","6534817","6534818","6534824","690634","697158","6993942","714808","7504911","7541965","7879723","7879730","7959195","8093931","8093932","8093934","8202914","8208315","8294083","8446501","8446502","8446504","8446505","8446506","8459091","8459093","8527041","859540","8612544","8615590","8681294","8714082","8714085","8714087","8838111","926743"]}

This method involves plowing along the natural contours of the land rather than in straight rows that follow the slope. By following the land's natural curves, contour plowing creates small ridges and furrows that help slow down the speed of water runoff. This reduction in runoff velocity allows more time for water to infiltrate the soil, rather than carrying away topsoil and nutrients. As a result, contour plowing helps preserve the fertility of the soil, reduces sedimentation in nearby water bodies, and promotes more sustainable farming practices. It is especially effective in hilly or sloped regions where erosion is a major concern.","dids":["182364","182365","182366","182367","182368","182369","182370","182371","182372","182373","188209","188210","188211","188213","188214","188215","188216","188217","188218","3511789","3785307","3785308","3785309","3785310","4449258","4449267","5189913","5576063","6001847","6392403","7125978","7125980","7125981","7125982","7125983","7125985","7125987","8052617","8052619","8052620","8052621","8052622","8052623","8052624","8089444","8235730"]}

The name is derived from the idea that only three percent of the American population is willing to stand up for their country in times of crisis, as opposed to the majority who are said to be loyal to the government. The movement is rooted in a belief in self-reliance, constitutional rights, and the right to bear arms, often emphasizing a distrust of federal authority and a desire for personal freedom.\n\nThe Three Percenters are not a formal organization but rather a loose network of individuals and groups who share similar values and beliefs. They often gather for training exercises, public demonstrations, and to promote their cause through media and social platforms. While some members may be law-abiding citizens who simply believe in gun rights and national sovereignty, others have been associated with extremist activities, including illegal weapons trafficking and acts of violence. The movement has been linked to various incidents and has drawn criticism from law enforcement and government officials for its potential to incite civil unrest. Despite the controversy, the Three Percenters continue to be a significant, albeit fringe, presence in American political and social discourse.","dids":["3423059","3423060","3423062","3423067","8049577","8049578","8049580","8049582","8049583","8049584","8049585","8049586"]}

This temperature is known as the boiling point of hydrogen under standard atmospheric pressure. Below this temperature, hydrogen remains in a liquid state, while above it, hydrogen exists as a gas. This low boiling point makes hydrogen one of the lightest and most volatile elements, requiring extreme cooling to maintain it in a liquid form.

is known for its tropical climate, characterized by warm temperatures and abundant sunshine throughout the year. The weather in Jamaica is generally pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 24\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C (75\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F). The island experiences two main seasons: the dry season, which runs from December to April, and the wet season, typically from May to November.
