msmarco_passage_02_179207466	During childhood and early adulthood, more bone is produced than removed, reaching its maximum mass and strength by the mid-30s. After that, bone is lost at a faster pace than it is formed, so the amount of bone in the skeleton begins to slowly decline.
msmarco_passage_02_179210433	They have smaller, thinner bones than men to begin with, and they lose bone mass more rapidly after menopause (usually around age 50), when they stop producing a bone-protecting hormone called estrogen. In the five to seven years following menopause, women can lose about 20% of their bone mass.
msmarco_passage_02_179211281	By age 65 or 70, though, men and women lose bone mass at the same rate. As an increasing number of men reach an older age, there is more awareness that osteoporosis is an important health issue for them as well.

msmarco_passage_02_437070914	Our bone continues to grow bigger and stronger until about the age of 30 when it reaches its peak. From that point on, our bone starts to lose its mineral content (bone mineral density) and structural strength. Bone formation ossification throughout different stages in your life. Osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_02_509511924	The average girl grows the fastest in height between the ages of 11 and 12 years, and stops growing between the ages of 14 and 15 years. About 95% of a young woman's peak bone mass is present by age 20, and some overall gains in mass often continue until age 30.
msmarco_passage_02_509514045	This process is called remodeling. Up until about age 40, all the bone removed is replaced. After age 40, however, less bone is replaced. At this stage in life, getting enough exercise and calcium (1,000 mg) and Vitamin D (1,000 IU) every day, are crucial to minimizing bone loss.
msmarco_passage_02_509809591	Building strong bones begins in childhood. The best time to build bone density is during years of rapid growth. We essentially develop the skeleton that must last our lifetime when we are between the ages of 10 and 18 years old. Our peak bone mass in maximum strength and density is achieved in our late twenties.
msmarco_passage_02_509810057	Once we reach the age of about 25, physical activity alone can no longer increase overall bone mass dramatically. In adults, bone density may increase 1-2 %, but this increase occurs only in the area of the skeleton that is stressed and this improved density will be lost if the loading exercise isn’t continued.
msmarco_passage_02_510477891	Before age 25, especially around the time of puberty and early adulthood, we can make bigger, thicker bones through weight-bearing exercise and good nutrition. After age 25, weight-bearing exercise can help decrease bone loss and maintain bone mass and strength, but it cannot make bigger bones.

msmarco_passage_02_77630808	If you don’t consume enough calcium and engage in physical activity as a child, you may not gain peak bone mass upon reaching adulthood. Women typically lose a large degree of bone mass after menopause while men begin losing bone mass after age 65, according to the "Encyclopedia of Sports Medicine and Science.".
msmarco_passage_03_308010621	Age has been associated with osteoporosis because after peak bone mass is reached, it gradually begins to decline. The more years that pass, the greater the loss of bone. As a rough estimate, we lose 10% of our bone mass per decade of life after the age of thirty.
msmarco_passage_03_526844941	At least 1/3 women and 1/5 men will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime. Many older adults do not know that they have weaker bones until they occur to fall. Women drastically lose bone mass during menopause, when the levels of bone-protecting hormone reduce.
msmarco_passage_03_813678029	Although less obvious during early adulthood, new bone formation continues into the late 20s or even early 30s, when bone mass and density peak. Beginning around age 30 or so, resorption gradually begins to exceed new bone formation frequency.
msmarco_passage_04_281806506	About five to 10 years after menopause starts, women can lose up to one-third of their bone mass. Men also lose bone mass as they age, but women tend to lose it faster. Any bone in the body can be affected by osteoporosis.

msmarco_passage_04_281823709	At about age 40, bone cells start to die at a more rapid rate than new cells are produced. This starts a slow decline in bone mass and may lead to the development of osteoporosis. During and after menopause, when estrogen (hormone) levels drop, women lose bone mass faster.
msmarco_passage_04_281825460	About five to 10 years after menopause starts, women can lose up to one-third of their bone mass. Men also lose bone mass as they age, but women tend to lose it faster. Any bone in the body can be affected by osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_04_638485877	During your childhood and teenage years, your body adds new bone faster than it gets rid of old bone. After about age 30, you can start to lose bone faster than your body makes bone, which makes your bones weaker and more likely to break. Some bone loss is natural as both men and women age.
msmarco_passage_04_94070356	How does age affects bone loss? How does age affects bone loss. ? From birth through adolescence, more bone is produced than is lost during bone remodeling. In young adults, the rates of bone production and loss are about the same. As the levels of sex steroids diminish during middle age, especially in women after menopause, a decrease in bone mass occurs because bone destruction outpaces bone formation.
msmarco_passage_04_94070926	Because women's bones generally are smaller than men's bones to begin with, loss of bone mass in old age typically causes greater problems in women. These factors contribute to a higher incidence of osteoporosis in women. Aging has two main effects on the skeletal system: Bones become more brittle and lose mass.
msmarco_passage_04_94071710	As a result, inorganic minerals gradually constitute a greater proportion of the bone extracellular matrix. Loss of bone mass results from demineralization and usually begins after age 30 in females, accelerates greatly around age 45 as levels of estrogens decrease, and continues until as much as 30% of the calcium in bones is lost by age 70. Once bone loss begins in females, about 8% of bone mass is lost every 10 years.
msmarco_passage_04_94072275	In males, calcium loss from bone typically does not begin until after age 60, and about 3% of bone mass is lost every 10 years. The loss of calcium from bones is one of the problems in osteoporosis (described in the Common Disorders section).
msmarco_passage_05_244547588	Bone is a living, growing tissue. During youth, your body makes new bone tissue faster than it breaks down older bone. In young adulthood, bone mass is at its peak; after that, bone loss starts to outpace bone growth, and bone mass decreases. But it's a long and very slow process that can be slowed down even more through calcium-rich diets and weight-bearing exercise.
msmarco_passage_05_398000222	In adults, this can take ten years. Until our mid-20s, bone density is still increasing. But at 35 bone loss begins as part of the natural ageing process. This becomes more rapid in post-menopausal women and can cause the bone-thinning condition osteoporosis.

msmarco_passage_06_122968429	Bone is added fastest during childhood and teenage years. As a result, bones become larger, heavier, and stronger (denser). Bone formation continues until the peak bone mass (maximum solidness and strength) is reached. Peak bone mass (or bone density) is reached around age 30.
msmarco_passage_06_122980219	Bone is added fastest during childhood and teenage years. As a result, bones become larger, heavier, and stronger (denser). Bone formation continues until the peak bone mass (maximum solidness and strength) is reached. Peak bone mass (or bone density) is reached around age 30.
msmarco_passage_06_125432336	Bone loss: Rapid bone loss is common during the perimenopausal years. Most women reach their peak bone density when aged 25 to 30 years. After that, bone loss averages 0.13% per year. During perimenopause, bone loss accelerates to about a 3% loss per year. Later, it drops off to about a 2% loss per year.

msmarco_passage_06_131887106	Building strong bones and reaching peak bone density (maximum strength and solidness) before the age of 30 can be the best defense against developing osteoporosis. Also, a healthy lifestyle can keep bones strong, especially for people older than 30 years of age.
msmarco_passage_06_426647517	Drinking alcohol. Too much alcohol can cause bone loss. We reach our peak bone mass at around age 30, but our bones continue to remodel. Cells known as osteoclasts breakdown bone, generally old and poorly structured bone and osteoblasts are cells that come in and lay down new bone.

msmarco_passage_06_721448383	When youre young, the process is skewed toward bone creation, and you have increasing bone density as you age, peaking at about age 30. After that, the process reaches equilibrium in adulthood. Then, as we age, the process can tip toward destruction, which can result in less dense, weaker bones.
msmarco_passage_06_728430886	However, if a person has low bone mass and continues to lose bone density, this may lead to osteoporosis. A combination of low bone mass and a risk factor for fracture may increase your risk for broken bones, too. Osteoporosis and broken bones do not need to be a normal part of aging.
msmarco_passage_06_728435519	Adults over age 50 with a disease or medical condition associated with low bone mass or bone loss. Adults over age 50 taking medications associated with low bone mass or bone loss. Premenopausal women and men under age 50, only in rare cases.
msmarco_passage_06_728442920	Is osteoporosis a normal part of aging? While it is typical to lose some bone mass as you age, it is not normal to have osteoporosis, to experience painful broken bones, or to lose more than 1-1/2 inches of height. Osteoporosis may be prevented and it is easily diagnosed and treated.
msmarco_passage_06_738637639	So, when estrogen plummets after menopause, bone mass tends to as well. Age: Maintaining that peak bone mass you had at 30 is like trying to stay your wedding-day weight--never going to happen. We slowly start to lose bone mass at age 40 and more rapidly in the next decade.
msmarco_passage_06_790722380	Women reach peak bone mass in their early thirties, and then it slowly declines from there, with an increase just after menopause. So our best strategy is to build up as much bone mass as we can until our early thirties, and then continue to prevent bone loss as much as we can.
msmarco_passage_07_553224572	Calcium ingested during the growing up years helps build strong bones. Adults achieve peak bone mass at the age of around 30 years. Adequate calcium intake to ensure optimum bone mass helps delay the onset of bone loss that occurs with age.
msmarco_passage_07_668691835	Osteoporosis. Your bones normally reach their maximum mass at age 25 to 30 after which they gradually lose density. Osteoporosis is characterized by an abnormal loss of bone mass and deterioration of normal bone structure. This causes bone fragility and an increased risk for fractures.
msmarco_passage_07_681556334	Because men also tend to burn more calories daily -- because they're larger -- it's easier for them to create a calorie deficit. The natural loss of lean muscle begins in your 40s and accelerates after you reach 50. While exercise and quality nutrition can mitigate the loss, some loss is inevitable. A normal weight-loss rate of 4 to 8 pounds a month is probably easier to achieve when you're in your 20s and 30s, but this rate may slow to 2 to 3 pounds a month later in life.
msmarco_passage_07_691169441	The normal healthy adult gets a T-Score of 0. If your T-score is more than one point (called a standard deviation) below 0, you may have weak bones, explains NIH. If your T score is between -1 and -2.5, you have low bone mass. If your score is -2.5 or lower, you have osteoporosis. Advertisement.
msmarco_passage_07_693339166	Osteoporosis. Your bones normally reach their maximum mass at age 25 to 30 after which they gradually lose density. Osteoporosis is characterized by an abnormal loss of bone mass and deterioration of normal bone structure. This causes bone fragility and an increased risk for fractures.
msmarco_passage_07_694615981	Aging and Lean Body Mass. As you age, you naturally lose lean body mass. Muscle loss, known as sarcopenia, is most prevalent after age 50 and occurs at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year, explains a 2003 review in the Journal of Gerontology. Bone density also diminishes slightly as you age, further reducing the weight of your lean body mass.
msmarco_passage_08_121374751	21. Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Osteopenia is the precursor to osteoporosis, a condition that increases the risk of bone fractures due to a severe decrease in bone density. Women’s bone mass reaches peak density when they are in their 20s and early 30s, and as they age, their bone mass begins to decrease.
msmarco_passage_08_128823305	Loss of Bone Density in Women. In women, bone density (or mass) progressively increases until about age 30, when bones are at their strongest. After that, bone density gradually decreases. The decrease in bone loss accelerates after menopause, which occurs on average around age 51.
msmarco_passage_08_13152487	When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created.
msmarco_passage_08_13195350	When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created.
msmarco_passage_08_13203596	When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created.
msmarco_passage_08_466342200	For most people, bone formation continues at a faster pace than removal until bone mass peaks during the third decade of life. After age 20, bone “withdrawals” can begin to exceed “deposits.”.
msmarco_passage_08_466394483	At that point, bones have reached their maximum strength and density, known as peak bone mass. Women tend to experience minimal change in total bone mass between age 30 and menopause.
msmarco_passage_08_466399312	For most people, bone mass peaks during the third decade of life. By this age, men typically have accumulated more bone mass than women. After this point, the amount of bone in the skeleton typically begins to decline slowly as removal of old bone exceeds formation of new bone.
msmarco_passage_08_466399731	Men in their fifties do not experience the rapid loss of bone mass that women do in the years following menopause. By age 65 or 70, however, men and women lose bone mass at the same rate, and the absorption of calcium, an essential nutrient for bone health throughout life, decreases in both sexes. Excessive bone loss causes bone to become fragile and more likely to fracture.
msmarco_passage_08_466420504	When you think of bones, you might imagine a hard, brittle skeleton. In reality, your bones are living organs. They are alive with cells and flowing body fluids. Bones are constantly renewed and grow stronger with a good diet and physical activity. After your mid-30s, you begin to slowly lose bone mass.
msmarco_passage_08_503133732	During childhood and early adulthood, the body creates new bone faster than it can absorb existing bone, a process that starts to reverse around age 30. Bone loss in women speeds up when the production of estrogen slows down, usually between the ages of 45-55.
msmarco_passage_08_672756935	After about 35 years  of age, you begin to lose more bone that your body makes. Most people lose about 1% of bone each year after their mid-thirties. Women in their  post menopausal year often experienced a much more dramatic increase in bone loss. They lose 4-5% of their bone each year for several years. But even at the low rate  of 1% a year, by age 65 even men have lost about 30% of their total bone mass.
msmarco_passage_08_713024938	It strengthens bones. Just as muscles grow stronger when physically stressed, bones also respond by getting stronger. Adults start losing bone mass in their 20s, but those who exercise regularly reach greater peak bone density (before the drop-off) than those who don't, according to the National Institutes of Health.
msmarco_passage_09_459016226	Bone up on calcium to prevent osteoporosis. You know it: Calcium is crucial for strong bones and teeth, and it is especially important for children and young adults to bone up on the mineral. Calcium absorption and bone development is at its peak up to age 20, and then decreases at around age 30 when a draining process begins.
msmarco_passage_09_646443662	Age: Most people (men and women) lose about .5% of bone mass every year after the age of 50. Lifestyle choices: A poor diet with a lack of calcium and vitamin D, smoking, excessive use of alcohol or caffeine, and lack of exercise contribute to a loss of bone mass.

msmarco_passage_10_452921056	In childhood and adolescence, most of our bone growth and bone density occurs. Girls reach their maximum bone density by age 18. For boys, this occurs by age 20. In adulthood, it is important to maintain bone density and try to slow the rate of bone loss. As we grow older, our bodies lose bone density.
msmarco_passage_10_669481249	Until about age 30, people normally build more bone than they lose. During the aging process, bone breakdown begins to outpace bone buildup, resulting in a gradual loss of bone mass. Once this loss of bone reaches a certain point, a person has osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_10_669572296	Until about age 30, people normally build more bone than they lose. During the aging process, bone breakdown begins to outpace bone buildup, resulting in a gradual loss of bone mass. Once this loss of bone reaches a certain point, a person has osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_10_673115327	by all means, take a supplement. For women, adult bone mass peaks at about age 30. With aging, bone lossgradually happens and then becomes increased after menopause. So it is important for young women to build good bone mass and for older women to do what they can to maintain it. How to Get Enough Calcium.
msmarco_passage_10_673220965	Osteopenia, if it happens at all, usually occurs after age 50. The exact age depends how strong your bones are when you're young. If they're hardy, you may never get osteopenia. If your bones aren't naturally dense, you may get it earlier.
msmarco_passage_10_673283536	During childhood, your bones become larger and stronger. Peak bone mass happens when you have the most bone you will ever have, usually in your early to mid-30s. At a certain age, the bone remodeling process changes. New bone comes in at a slower rate. This slowdown leads to a drop in the amount of bone you have.
msmarco_passage_10_673366077	Although most of the bone density may return during puberty, children with juvenile osteoporosis usually have lower peak bone mass as adults. No matter what the cause, juvenile osteoporosis is a very serious condition. You build about 90% of your bone mass by the time you're ages 18 to 20.
msmarco_passage_10_687531882	Continued. Bone loss -- where bone breakdown goes faster than bone buildup -- usually begins in the mid-30s. Bones begin to lose calcium -- the mineral that makes them hard -- faster than they can replace it. Less bone remodeling takes place and the bones begin to thin.
msmarco_passage_11_460327858	Abstract. A physiologically based model of normal bone loss in human aging is presented. The model is a modification of an existing physiologically based model of body and bone growth from birth to maturity. To account for loss of bone after peak bone mass is reached between ages 25 and 30 years, a slow first-order loss of bone is incorporated into the existing model.
msmarco_passage_11_460329570	Bone loss with age is a natural phenomenon. Bone mass peaks around ages 25–30 years and declines gradually thereafter in both men and women ( Exton-Smith et al., 1969; Firooznia et al., 1984a ). The amount of bone in older people is determined by the peak bone mass, together with the rate of bone loss with age.
msmarco_passage_11_460337996	The curves for total skeletal weight as functions of age in men and women (ICRP, 1992) suggest establishment of maximum bone mass by age 20, with observable bone loss beginning about age 37. Some bone is actually lost before age 37, probably beginning as early as age 30 ( Riggs et al., 1981 ).
msmarco_passage_11_67024711	In adults, this occurs at a rate of about 10% each year. This is a natural process to ensure maintenance of normal bone mass as a person ages. Normal bone mass indicates healthy bones that are free of problems such as osteoporosis. The remodeling cycle usually starts when injury or mechanical stresses occur in bones.
msmarco_passage_11_811197223	Bone “growth” is complete and “peaks” by the time the individual is age 30. Between age 30 until menopause (around age 51 in women and around age 70 in men), there is a balance between the osteoblast and osteoclast activity.
msmarco_passage_12_548620421	That’s because they have larger voice boxes that make the surrounding cartilage stick out more. Both sexes hit peak bone mass around age 30. At 40, men and women start losing bone. Menopause accelerates bone loss in women. So, women 51-70 need 200 milligrams (mg) of calcium more than men the same age.
msmarco_passage_12_643059786	Calcium. Note that bone mass can keep increasing during life until you are 30-40 years of age. Later years, net bone loss can happen when bone resorption surpluses the amount of bone produced. Bones can keep losing their density every year after 30 in men and women.
msmarco_passage_14_182109744	Age. Our bones increase in density and strength until we reach our late 20s. Around the age of 35 we start to lose bone density as part of the natural ageing process. This happens gradually over time but is much more significant after the menopause. A large reduction in bone density is known as osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_14_655004849	You begin to lose bone after the age of 30 and the loss speeds up after menopause. In fact, women lose up to 2% of their bone density each decade after menopause. It’s a gradual but relentless process.
msmarco_passage_15_563430484	Graph Showing Relationship Between Age and Bone Mass. Bone density peaks at about 30 years of age. Women lose bone mass more rapidly than men. Figure 2 shows that women lose bone mass more quickly than men starting at about 50 years of age.

msmarco_passage_15_614709110	After this bone is set, a callus will knit the two ends together. (credit: Bill Rhodes) Bone remodeling allows bones to adapt to stresses by becoming thicker and stronger when subjected to stress. Bones that are not subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass.
msmarco_passage_16_132540668	Maximum bone density & strength occurs at age 25 to 35. Bone Loss. After age 35, old bone is is removed faster than it is replaced. Menopause – increased bone loss due to reduced estrogen production. Excess bone loss – more fragile bone. Once bone is lost, it is very difficult to replace. Dental Implants and Osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_16_353907986	Calcium. Calcium is a key nutrient that helps your body build new bones and keeps those bones strong. While most women don't begin to experience bone thinning until after age 30, it's recommended that women begin to eat a diet rich in calcium in their 20s to stave off bone loss later in life.
msmarco_passage_17_209244396	Education. |. Science. By Joshua Bush. Bones are rigid because most of their mass comes from mineralized calcium and phosphate. After a certain age, usually around 40 years old, people naturally begin to lose calcium from their bones, which reduces the strength of the bones. Investigate the process of bone decay by experimenting with small bones soaked in an acid.
msmarco_passage_18_815318946	Bone mass is now thought to peak between the ages of 18-25. Thus, behaviors which result in low bone density in youth could be detrimental to an athlete’s bone health throughout her lifetime. In addition, ovulation is the primary way that females create the hormone progesterone.

msmarco_passage_22_256176072	Osteoporosis is a disease of the bones. It causes you to lose bone mass. Osteoporosis occurs most often in older adults. Women are more likely to have it than men. This is due to several factors. Women have less bone mass than men to begin with. Women also tend to live longer and absorb less calcium.
msmarco_passage_22_531523984	By Dr. Mercola. Bone weakening is a common problem associated with aging. In most people, sometime during your 30s, your bone mass will begin to gradually decline. For women, that bone loss can significantly speed up during the first 10 years after menopause.
msmarco_passage_23_614913432	Bone Up — The Need-to-Know. Our bodies are building up those bones until about age 30, when they typically reach peak bone mass (which varies from person to person). Bones are constantly being broken down and rebuilt in tiny amounts. Before reaching peak bone mass, the body is creating new bone faster, but after age 30, the bone building balance naturally shifts and more bone is lost than gained.
msmarco_passage_24_115356547	Osteoporosis. Your bones normally reach their maximum mass at age 25 to 30 after which they gradually lose density. Osteoporosis is characterized by an abnormal loss of bone mass and deterioration of normal bone structure. This causes bone fragility and an increased risk for fractures.
msmarco_passage_24_119654821	Diminished bone density due to aging contributes to postural problems, resulting in a postural slump. Though these factors cause height decreases because of aging, they can also occur as result of bone and mineral loss from an unhealthy weight loss. Your body reaches peak height up to age 40.
msmarco_passage_24_124648822	Osteoporosis. Your bones normally reach their maximum mass at age 25 to 30 after which they gradually lose density.

Osteoporosis is characterized by an abnormal loss of bone mass and deterioration of normal bone structure. This causes bone fragility and an increased risk for fractures.
msmarco_passage_24_294195904	According to the University of Arizona's "Bone Builders" website, "the more bone mass you build before age 25 or 30, the better off you will be during the years of gradual bone loss.". Even as you age, weight-bearing exercises can reduce bone loss -- helping to prevent osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_24_309211491	Why Is Lifting Weights Good for You? How Does a Fractured Finger Heal? How to Lose the Flab After Losing Weight. Share on Facebook. Your bones provide a framework for your body -- and the stronger your framework, the less likely you are to experience painful bone breaks. As you age, you start to lose bone mass.
msmarco_passage_24_52598713	However, if a person has low bone mass and continues to lose bone density, this may lead to osteoporosis. A combination of low bone mass and a risk factor for fracture may increase your risk for broken bones, too. Osteoporosis and broken bones do not need to be a normal part of aging.
msmarco_passage_24_57743132	Muscle mass in both men and women begins to decline as early as one’s 30s, replaced by – gasp! – flab. By age 75, the average person’s fat content is twice that of their youth. Your teeth are less sensitive – and not just because you might have fewer of them.

msmarco_passage_25_855923605	Just after puberty (about 15-17 years) 90% of bone growth is complete and there is only a small increase in bone strength after this age until the age of 30. From our mid 30s onwards, more bone is broken down than made. This results in a gradual decrease in bone strength as we age.
msmarco_passage_26_111320323	Effects Of Aging On Bones! From the onset of age about 30, the density of bones starts diminishing in men and women. This loss of bone density speeds up in women after menopause. As a result, bones become more fragile and likely to break, especially in old age. Bone health is a major concern among the aging population.
msmarco_passage_26_111321315	How to Keep Your Aging Bones Strong? It’s true that bone loss is an unavoidable effect of aging, but there are ways to minimize this loss and keep your bones as healthy as possible. Read on here all you need to know about how to prevent loss in bone density as you age and keep your bones strong in later years. # 1.
msmarco_passage_26_375545328	As a result, bones become larger, heavier, and denser. Bone formation happens faster than bone resorption until a person reaches their peak bone mass (maximum bone density and strength) between the ages of 25 and 30 years.
msmarco_passage_26_375545679	After this peak period, bone resorption occurs faster than the rate of bone formation, leading to net bone loss. The age at which an individual begins to experience symptoms of bone loss depends on the amount of bone that was developed during their youth and the rate of bone resorption.
msmarco_passage_26_846132892	If you don’t consume enough calcium and engage in physical activity as a child, you may not gain peak bone mass upon reaching adulthood. Women typically lose a large degree of bone mass after menopause while men begin losing bone mass after age 65, according to the "Encyclopedia of Sports Medicine and Science.".
msmarco_passage_27_502235376	During childhood and early adulthood, more bone is produced than removed, reaching its maximum mass and strength by the mid-30s. After that, bone is lost at a faster pace than it is formed, so the amount of bone in the skeleton begins to slowly decline.
msmarco_passage_27_502238343	They have smaller, thinner bones than men to begin with, and they lose bone mass more rapidly after menopause (usually around age 50), when they stop producing a bone-protecting hormone called estrogen. In the five to seven years following menopause, women can lose about 20% of their bone mass.
msmarco_passage_27_502238767	By age 65 or 70, though, men and women lose bone mass at the same rate. As an increasing number of men reach an older age, there is more awareness that osteoporosis is an important health issue for them as well.
msmarco_passage_27_617061334	Medicines for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become brittle and more likely to fracture (break). With osteoporosis, the bones lose density. Bone density is the amount of calcified bone tissue that is in your bones.
msmarco_passage_27_643784946	By age 30, most individuals have reached their peak bone mass and gradually lose bone mass over time. If you wait until your bone density declines to the point where you have osteoporosis, you’re going to have to maintain or gradually build from that starting point. Exercise can help you can stave off that decline.
msmarco_passage_27_868618164	Between 20 and 40 years of age, bones remain at a fairly constant level of strength. After age 40, bone density gradually declines. As people reach older age, bones that are weakened by declining bone density may become easily broken with even minor falls.
msmarco_passage_27_95413114	Diet and exercise can significantly affect the ability to achieve one’s genetically determined peak bone mass. (More information) Beginning around age 34, the rate of bone resorption outpaces that of bone formation, leading to an inevitable loss of bone mass with age.

msmarco_passage_28_492906973	Bone minerals are detected with a bone mineral density scant, also called a DEXA scan. Bone mineral density increases throughout childhood and into adulthood until about the age of 30. It can then begin to decline. Bone density is lost fastest during the 10 years following menopause.
msmarco_passage_28_625525754	I have heard that we lose bone mass as we age, but what about muscle mass? Is that also a normal part of aging? Does exercise slow the progression or is muscle loss inevitable?
msmarco_passage_28_692972487	Detecting Low Bone Density. A bone density test will determine whether you have normal bone density, low bone density or osteoporosis. Having low bone density does not necessarily mean you are losing bone. Your bone density may still be considered normal for you.
msmarco_passage_28_692972895	Low Bone Density. Low bone density is when your bone density is lower than normal, but not low enough to be considered osteoporosis. It may mean that you have a greater chance of getting osteoporosis if you lose bone in the future because you have less bone to lose.
msmarco_passage_28_692973293	Some people never have normal bone density for a variety of reasons, including genetics, body size or certain diseases and conditions. The older you are, the more likely you are to have low bone density.
msmarco_passage_28_692974022	A person with a T-score of -2.2 has lower bone density than a person with a T-score of -1.2. If you have low bone density, your healthcare provider may recommend that you start taking an osteoporosis medicine. Be sure to talk about the risks and benefits of taking (or not taking) a medicine.
msmarco_passage_29_243429621	Before age 25, especially around the time of puberty and early adulthood, we can make bigger, thicker bones through weight-bearing exercise and good nutrition. After age 25, weight-bearing exercise can help decrease bone loss and maintain bone mass and strength, but it cannot make bigger bones.
msmarco_passage_29_243460211	Building strong bones begins in childhood. The best time to build bone density is during years of rapid growth. We essentially develop the skeleton that must last our lifetime when we are between the ages of 10 and 18 years old. Our peak bone mass in maximum strength and density is achieved in our late twenties.
msmarco_passage_29_243460678	Once we reach the age of about 25, physical activity alone can no longer increase overall bone mass dramatically. In adults, bone density may increase 1-2 %, but this increase occurs only in the area of the skeleton that is stressed and this improved density will be lost if the loading exercise isn’t continued.
msmarco_passage_29_243479821	This process is called remodeling. Up until about age 40, all the bone removed is replaced. After age 40, however, less bone is replaced. At this stage in life, getting enough exercise and calcium (1,000 mg) and Vitamin D (1,000 IU) every day, are crucial to minimizing bone loss.
msmarco_passage_29_297829269	Calcium. Your bones reach their peak strength between the ages of 20 and 30. After that, they lose about 0.5 to 1 percent of their density every year until menopause, when the loss of minerals increases.

msmarco_passage_30_608937387	The reduction of bone mass begins between ages 30 and 40, and continues to decline. Women lose about 8% of skeletal mass every decade, while men lose about 3%. Epiphyses, vertebrae, and the jaws lose more mass than other sites, resulting in fragile limbs, reduction in height, and loss of teeth.

msmarco_passage_32_620978484	Age: Most people (men and women) lose about .5% of bone mass every year after the age of 50. Lifestyle choices: A poor diet with a lack of calcium and vitamin D, smoking, excessive use of alcohol or caffeine, and lack of exercise contribute to a loss of bone mass.
msmarco_passage_33_548271100	Bone resorption is the process by which osteoclasts break down bone tissue to release the mineral contents into the bloodstream. Your bone production naturally begins to slow down around age 30, which can cause an overall loss of bone mass for some people.
msmarco_passage_34_143886340	The amount of bone tissue will reach its highest level near age 30 and then will gradually taper off as we age. It is important to support bone growth during our younger years by consuming sufficient calcium so that we still have adequate bone mass when we are older.
msmarco_passage_34_93901849	Why dietary calcium is important. Our bones reach their highest mass during our 20s. Our bones later lose density during normal “ageing”, increasing the risk of fracture. It’s estimated that a fracture occurs every 3.6 minutes in Australian adults aged 50 years and over.
msmarco_passage_35_634482090	Plants age too, but the signs are much harder to detect. Most body parts grow bigger and stronger, and function more efficiently during childhood. They reach their peak at the time of maturity, or early adulthood. After that, they begin to decline. Bones, for example, gradually become lighter and more brittle.

msmarco_passage_36_407777498	Bone Basics. Everyday wear-and-tear gradually damages bones. To keep them strong, your body constantly removes old bone and replaces it with new. This remodeling process is slow -- most of your bone is totally replaced every 10 years -- but after age 30, bone tends to lose minerals faster than they’re replaced.
msmarco_passage_37_336459891	And definitely check out the recipe section of our blog for quick, easy, and delicious bone-healthy recipes the whole family can enjoy. After peak bone mass, which most people reach around age 40, you begin to lose 1% of your total bone mineral density each year.
msmarco_passage_39_125029338	Let’s take a look at the two conditions from a bone density perspective. Bone density is a measurement of the density and strength of bones. Peak bone density occurs around the age of 30, but after that, people gradually begin to lose bone mass.
msmarco_passage_39_276490704	By the end of your teens, bone growth has been completed and by about 25 to 30 years of age, peak bone mass is achieved. Sex hormones, such as oestrogen and testosterone, have a fundamental role in maintaining bone strength in men and women. The fall in oestrogen that occurs during menopause results in accelerated bone loss.
msmarco_passage_39_279314572	Muscle mass can increase in the older person after regularly exercising for a relatively short period of time. Bone – bone density begins to decline after the age of 40, but this loss accelerates around the age of 50 years. As a result of this bone loss, older people are more prone to bone fractures.
msmarco_passage_39_311931407	Men, on the other hand, start to lose bone mass at a faster rate at the age of 65. Additional factors to consider for people who are at high risk for losing bone mass is a small body frame and long-term use of corticosteroids.
msmarco_passage_39_461879190	Apparently, many of these drugs solve one problem only to create ten more. This brings to mind a concern for those who are taking drugs for osteoporosis. As we age, so does the structure of our bones. After the age of 40, adults begin to lose bone as the body’s ability to build up bone tissues decreases. Adults who have the most risk for bone loss include:
msmarco_passage_39_714339196	Less than -2.5: Osteoporosis. Your bone mass is more than 2.5 standard deviations lower than the average for healthy young women. Your bone mass is much lower than normal and your fracture risk is three times higher than average. Your bone mass is lower than 99% of healthy young, adult women.2. Often your bone density test will state your chronological age and your average age for your bone density measurement.
msmarco_passage_39_739214718	For most people, bone formation continues at a faster pace than removal until bone mass peaks during the third decade of life. After age 20, bone “withdrawals” can begin to exceed “deposits.”.
msmarco_passage_39_739236196	At that point, bones have reached their maximum strength and density, known as peak bone mass. Women tend to experience minimal change in total bone mass between age 30 and menopause.
msmarco_passage_39_739295456	For most people, bone mass peaks during the third decade of life. By this age, men typically have accumulated more bone mass than women. After this point, the amount of bone in the skeleton typically begins to decline slowly as removal of old bone exceeds formation of new bone.
msmarco_passage_39_739295876	Men in their fifties do not experience the rapid loss of bone mass that women do in the years following menopause. By age 65 or 70, however, men and women lose bone mass at the same rate, and the absorption of calcium, an essential nutrient for bone health throughout life, decreases in both sexes. Excessive bone loss causes bone to become fragile and more likely to fracture.
msmarco_passage_39_862340442	After about age 30, you can start to lose bone faster than your body makes it, which can weaken the bones and increase the risk of breakage. Some bone loss is natural as men and women age, but women are at higher risk of significant bone loss.
msmarco_passage_39_863909007	Age. Our bones increase in density and strength until we reach our late 20s. Around the age of 35 we start to lose bone density as part of the natural ageing process. This happens gradually over time but is much more significant after the menopause. A large reduction in bone density is known as osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_40_137452930	Bone mass reaches its peak during young adulthood. Then, after a period of stability, there is a slow but steady loss of bone beginning about age 40. In women, normal aging and menopause significantly increase susceptibility to osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_40_394989603	The 20s represent the point at which women reach peak bone mass — the time in their lives when their bones are at maximum natural density and strength.
msmarco_passage_40_394990314	For others it may be later, but after the peak bone mass point is reached, things don't get better for your bones; they begin the process of slow degradation that happens as you age. This may actually begin in your 20s, so it's never too early to start getting that calcium. 4. Skin.
msmarco_passage_40_635138235	The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reported that most of us start losing muscles around age 30, with a 3 to 8 percent reduction in lean muscle mass every decade thereafter. Strengthening exercises are beneficial for older adults because these exercises help build muscle strength and muscle mass and preserve bone density.
msmarco_passage_42_789639101	4. Supports Bone Health By Increasing Bone Density. Most people reach their peak bone mass by the age of 30. Thereafter, bone density declines, increasing the chances for osteoporosis and fractures. 8 The loss in bone mass is a major problem of aging, particularly in postmenopausal women.
msmarco_passage_42_796565324	1. Add More Calcium In Diet. Calcium is a mineral essential to building bones and keeping them healthy. Women experience increased bone loss in the years that immediately follow menopause though bone loss continues to old age.

msmarco_passage_44_339877660	When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created.
msmarco_passage_44_461409698	This causes bones to lose minerals, heaviness (mass), and structure, making them weaker and more prone to breaking, leading to osteopenia. All people begin losing bone mass after they reach peak BMD at about 30 years of age. The thicker your bones are by about age 30, the longer it takes to develop osteopenia or osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_44_461415438	Osteoporosis refers to a loss of bone mass causing the bones to become porous and fragile. Our skeletal frames are constantly being remodeled, with bone tissue being broken down and rebuilt on a regular basis. Bone density (the degree of mineralization of the bone matrix) usually increases until about the age of 30, but after that, trouble can begin.

msmarco_passage_45_185145068	The density and strength of the bones is fairly stable from 25-45 years of age. A slight loss of bone density begins to occur after age 30 because bone slowly begins to break down (a process called resorption) faster than new bone is formed.
msmarco_passage_45_185150228	Osteoporosis is preventable by reaching the peak bone mass (maximum bone density and strength) during the childhood and teenage years and by continuing to build more bone as one gets older, particularly after the age of 30. A few things that can be done to maintain healthy bone are as follows:
msmarco_passage_45_190235407	Building strong bones and reaching peak bone density (maximum strength and solidness) before the age of 30 can be the best defense against developing osteoporosis. Also, a healthy lifestyle can keep bones strong, especially for people older than 30 years of age.

After that the body continues to accumulate bone tissue but at a much slower rate. Peak bone mass is acheived when the bones have reached their maximum strength and density. The process is completed around the age of 30.
msmarco_passage_45_325405848	Loss of Bone. Bone density remains more or less the same until women reach the age of 35 years. However, after crossing this age, women lose 1 percent of bone each year. This loss of bone can be stopped by weight bearing exercises and strength training. It can even help in making bones denser and stronger.

msmarco_passage_45_623133409	That’s because men have greater bone density going into middle age and their rate of bone density loss is generally more gradual. If men do develop osteoporosis, it’s typically later in life than women do. “However, once men develop osteoporosis, they are more likely than women to experience a fracture.
msmarco_passage_45_623137943	Osteoporosis is a disease of the bone — in fact, the term osteoporosis actually means “porous bones.”. People with osteoporosis lose too much bone mass, make too little new bone tissue, or both, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF). About 54 million Americans already have osteoporosis or low bone mass ( osteopenia ), a condition that increases your risk for osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_45_623164351	Osteoporosis is more likely to develop if you did not reach optimal peak bone mass during your bone-building years. You reach your maximum bone density and strength around age 30, after which time bone resorption slowly overtakes bone formation.

msmarco_passage_48_775268253	Women experience rapid bone loss following menopause, but by 65 to 70 years old, men lose bone mass at about the same rate. Kidney and thyroid problems, vitamin D deficiency, and prolonged exposure to steroids, cancer therapies, and anti-convulsants put you more at risk.
msmarco_passage_48_808765660	This may lead to the calcium depletion in bones, a process that can take many years. During childhood, people undergo a great amount of bone formation. Most individuals can continue to build bone mass until their mid-30s. However, after age 35, they can only slow the bone loss, which is a natural part of aging.
msmarco_passage_49_11921865	Calcium: The Teen Bone Builder. Page Content. Article Body. During the teenage years, the growing bones absorb more calcium from the blood than at any other time of life.

msmarco_passage_49_471616753	Until about age 25, this project adds more new bone than it takes away, so bone density increases. From about age 25 to age 50, bone density tends to stay stable with equal amounts of bone formation and bone breakdown.
msmarco_passage_49_486586223	Your highest bone mass (size and thickness) is reached between ages 20 and 25, and it declines after that. After menopause, however, women begin to lose bone at an even faster rate. Osteoporosis develops when your body cannot replace bone as fast as it is broken down.
msmarco_passage_49_486599463	Bones not only get longer and wider, they also get denser (thicker). People reach their peak bone mass—their largest and densest bone— by their late teens or early twenties. As early as age 30, some bones begin to slowly lose mass as a normal part of aging.
msmarco_passage_49_487162093	Why is bone health important? Bone is a living tissue that is constantly breaking down and being replaced. Throughout life, your body balances the loss of bone with the creation of new bone. You reach your highest bone mass (size and strength) at about age 30, usually between ages 20 to 25. After that, you begin to lose bone mass.
msmarco_passage_49_487167527	Bones not only get longer and wider, they also get denser (thicker). People reach their peak bone mass—their largest and densest bone— by their late teens or early twenties. As early as age 30, some bones begin to slowly lose mass as a normal part of aging.
msmarco_passage_49_699624577	The first is a failure to reach one’s peak bone mass, which is the maximum amount of bone a person is genetically programmed to build in her lifetime. Peak bone mass is typically reached by age 20 in men and age 30 in women. The second cause is a loss of bone once a person has reached peak bone mass.
msmarco_passage_50_2996334	The amount of bone tissue we have continues to grow as we age, but peaks around the age of 30, and then it begins to decline. This means that your bones are the strongest around age 30, then you become prone to developing osteopenia if you don’t pay attention to your diet and lifestyle. Getting the right minerals and vitamins from diet and practicing weight-bearing exercises or whole body vibration exercises can help in preventing or slowing down bone loss and in delaying the onset of osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_50_560437300	It is true that women are at a greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Risk of osteoporosis in women is due to the inherent low bone density in women and because women lose bone mass more quickly as they age as compared to men.
msmarco_passage_50_599904435	At about the age of 30 our bones are about as strong as they will ever be. From then on, the rate of bone turnover gradually changes: more bone is dissolved than is produced. After about the age of 50, this process starts to speed up, especially in women.
msmarco_passage_51_238981707	Bone fractures and breaks are all too common in older adults because of loss of bone density and osteoporosis. While there can be other causes of osteoporosis, and it may need to be managed medically, there is plenty of evidence that exercise can improve bone density.
msmarco_passage_52_392293519	The body constantly breaks down old bone and builds up new bone. In the first decades of life, bone density increases. Then  it plateaus for about two more decades. At around age 40, bone density begins to decrease. In women, the  speed of bone loss accelerates with the onset of menopause.
msmarco_passage_52_400804989	Who is this bone density screening for? All adults age 50+, including men, and adults age 40+ who have any risk factors for bone loss should receive a bone density test. About 54 million Americans have osteoporosis and low bone mass, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_53_343794226	When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created.
msmarco_passage_53_564392719	Do you shrink with age? Research shows we do. Unless you have a bone disease, shrinking in height is considered a normal part of aging. People typically start to shrink after the age of 40 and lose about half an inch each decade. After the age of 80, it’s possible for both men and women to lose another inch.
msmarco_passage_53_652221590	Introduction. Osteoporosis in younger women results from either a low peak bone mass, increased bone loss prior to menopause or both. [ 1] . Peak bone mass is reached by 30 years of age with 90% of the development completed by 18 years of age. [ 2] . For most women, bone mass remains stable until menopause, when the loss of estrogen in conjunction with aging is associated with a decline in bone mineral density (BMD).
msmarco_passage_53_747876151	Loss of Bone Density in Women. In women, bone density (or mass) progressively increases until about age 30, when bones are at their strongest. After that, bone density gradually decreases. The decrease in bone loss accelerates after menopause, which occurs on average around age 51.
msmarco_passage_54_645999114	Individuals who are younger continue their bone formation till the body has reached the peak bone mass. Usually after the age of 30, the rate of bone resorption is higher than the body can create new ones and as a result bone mass is lost.
msmarco_passage_54_710317822	Peak bone density (mass) is reached between the ages of 25 and 30. As one ages, bone loss slowly begins to increase. With increased bone loss, the rate of bone generation will also decrease. The chances of developing osteoporosis depend on the density of one’s bones earlier in life.
msmarco_passage_54_710318736	In men, gradual bone loss will normally begin between the ages of 45 and 50, this is when testosterone production begins to slow. Osteoporosis usually only impacts people when they are over the age of 60.
msmarco_passage_55_149798928	Minerals in your bones are incorporated during childhood, early adulthood and adolescence. Peak bone mass is reached at 30 years of age. If bone mass is not enough at this age or you experience loss of bone later in life, then you are at greater risk of developing weak bones that can break easily.
msmarco_passage_55_217686589	Bone mass is at its maximum between ages 25 and 35 years and after this, there is a gradual decrease, which becomes more prominent with time 11. Older adults should seek to get enough protein through a healthy and balanced diet, and/or with the support of high quality nutritional supplements.
msmarco_passage_55_28646723	But by the time we reach 30 years of age, our bones have reached their peak and begin to decline. We end up losing more existing bone than rebuilding new bone. The good news is there are things you can do to build up and strengthen the density of your bones.
msmarco_passage_55_416926884	The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women aged 65 and older be screened (tested) for osteoporosis, as well as women under age 65 who are at increased risk for an osteoporosis-related fracture. A bone mineral density test compares your bone density to the bones of an average healthy young adult.
msmarco_passage_55_416929134	Osteoporosis is not just a woman’s disease. Not as many men have it as women do, maybe because most men start with more bone density. As they age, men lose bone density more slowly than women. But, men need to be aware of osteoporosis. Experts don’t know as much about this disease in men as they do in women. However, many of the things that put men at risk are the same as those for women, including family history, not enough calcium or vitamin D, and too little exercise.
msmarco_passage_55_419243222	For most people, bone formation continues at a faster pace than removal until bone mass peaks during the third decade of life. After age 20, bone “withdrawals” can begin to exceed “deposits.”.
msmarco_passage_55_419260877	At that point, bones have reached their maximum strength and density, known as peak bone mass. Women tend to experience minimal change in total bone mass between age 30 and menopause.
msmarco_passage_55_419277340	When you think of bones, you might imagine a hard, brittle skeleton. In reality, your bones are living organs. They are alive with cells and flowing body fluids. Bones are constantly renewed and grow stronger with a good diet and physical activity. After your mid-30s, you begin to slowly lose bone mass.
msmarco_passage_55_419567963	How bones grow. Think of your bones as a “bank” where you “deposit” and “withdraw” bone tissue. During your childhood and teenage years, new bone is added (or deposited) to the skeleton faster than old bone is removed (or withdrawn). As a result, your bones become larger, heavier, and denser. For most people, bone formation continues at a faster pace than removal until sometime after age 20.
msmarco_passage_55_419827951	At that point, bones have reached their maximum strength and density, known as peak bone mass. Women tend to experience minimal change in total bone mass between age 30 and menopause.
msmarco_passage_55_507025310	Detecting Low Bone Density. A bone density test will determine whether you have normal bone density, low bone density or osteoporosis. Having low bone density does not necessarily mean you are losing bone. Your bone density may still be considered normal for you.
msmarco_passage_55_507025718	Low Bone Density. Low bone density is when your bone density is lower than normal, but not low enough to be considered osteoporosis. It may mean that you have a greater chance of getting osteoporosis if you lose bone in the future because you have less bone to lose.
msmarco_passage_55_507026116	Some people never have normal bone density for a variety of reasons, including genetics, body size or certain diseases and conditions. The older you are, the more likely you are to have low bone density.
msmarco_passage_55_507026845	A person with a T-score of -2.2 has lower bone density than a person with a T-score of -1.2. If you have low bone density, your healthcare provider may recommend that you start taking an osteoporosis medicine. Be sure to talk about the risks and benefits of taking (or not taking) a medicine.
msmarco_passage_55_507171558	This means their bones continue getting denser until they reach what experts call peak bone mass, the point when you have the greatest amount of bone you will ever have. Peak bone mass usually happens between the ages of 18 and 25.
msmarco_passage_55_507179085	Low Bone Density. Low bone density is when your bone density is lower than normal, but not low enough to be considered osteoporosis. People with low bone density are more likely to break a bone and may have a greater chance of getting osteoporosis because they have less bone to lose.
msmarco_passage_55_724398552	In the average person, bone mass density peaks before the age of 30 ( 28 ). After this time, there is a slow and gradual loss of bone which continues into old age. Over time, extensive bone loss can lead to osteoporosis, a condition that causes fragile bones, decreased mobility, frailty, falls, and injuries ( 29 ).
msmarco_passage_55_786738999	With age, virtually everyone loses bone density, a process that typically starts at age 30 and accelerates rapidly in women past menopause who do not take supplemental estrogen. In men, who enter adulthood with thicker, stronger bones, bone loss in midlife is more gradual but often becomes medically significant after age 70.
msmarco_passage_56_498506053	It strengthens bones. Just as muscles grow stronger when physically stressed, bones also respond by getting stronger. Adults start losing bone mass in their 20s, but those who exercise regularly reach greater peak bone density (before the drop-off) than those who don't, according to the National Institutes of Health.
msmarco_passage_56_557723010	Different stages of the condition. Between the ages of 18 to 30, the bone attains its peak bone mass, ie, bone will reach their maximum strength and density. Later, after 30 years of age, minimal changes start in the bone leading to osteoporosis. This can be staged as:
msmarco_passage_57_535171510	Losing Bone. Usually around age 30, the reverse begins happening. We start losing bone faster than it’s made. By menopause (and for men about age 60), small holes like broken spider webs begin to appear in the calcium crystals that hold bone together. These holes can grow and grow until bones begin to crumble.
msmarco_passage_57_92668378	The Aging Bone. Bones undergo a lifelong process of remodeling – mature bone tissue is removed and new bone tissue is formed. Bone remodeling is a highly regulated process that maintains a balance between bone resorption and formation, thus maintaining skeletal integrity. This balance changes with increasing age, resulting in loss of bone tissue.

msmarco_passage_60_480702747	You may be losing bone mass sooner than you think. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases National Resource Center, the peak age for bone mineral density, or age when bones are the strongest, is age 18 for women and age 20 for men.
msmarco_passage_60_480703156	This loss jumps to about 4% per year during the five to 10 years after menopause (around ages 45 to 55). The natural decline in estrogen at menopause speeds up the breakdown of bone. For those who did not drink milk during childhood and adolescence, or for those with several risk factors, this rate could be higher.
msmarco_passage_60_480703613	Throughout childhood and into young adulthood, we are adding to our bone stores by eating healthy sources of calcium and getting in daily weight-bearing exercise. Once age 30 rolls around, we start to lose our bone stores.

The average American will gain about one pound of additional weight each year from age 25, or 35 additional pounds by the age of 60; because we typically also lose about a half pound of bone and muscle mass each year -- unless we're physically active, of course -- then our body fat is increasing by 1.5 pounds each year from the age of 25 to 60, or more than 50 pounds of fat over 35 years.
msmarco_passage_60_838703428	Cross-cultural studies show that, throughout the world, most people lose bone mass as they age. 13 After age 40 to 50, men lose 20 to 30 percent of their total bone mass, and women lose as much as 40 to 50 percent. 14 Generally, though, the remaining bone is healthy and able to repair itself.
msmarco_passage_61_171492944	Low bone mass, called osteopenia, is the precursor to osteoporosis and can lead to osteoporosis. Bone mass peaks around 35 years of age. For example, if you have about 100% of your bone mass at age 50 (menopause), you will lose about 3% of your bone mass silently for about 5 years after menopause. That's 15%.

msmarco_passage_61_313365094	Age: Most people (men and women) lose about .5% of bone mass every year after the age of 50. Lifestyle choices: A poor diet with a lack of calcium and vitamin D, smoking, excessive use of alcohol or caffeine, and lack of exercise contribute to a loss of bone mass.
msmarco_passage_62_752021905	Produced by the ovaries, estrogen has been shown to have a protective effect on bone. Women usually go through menopause between age 45 and 55. After menopause, bone loss in women greatly exceeds that in men. However, by age 65, women and men tend to lose bone tissue at the same rate. Although men do not undergo the equivalent of menopause, production of the male hormone testosterone may decrease, and this can lead to increased bone loss and a greater risk of developing osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_64_431617227	Humans typically build up bone mass until their 20’s or 30’s. At that point, both men and women begin to lose bone density as a normal part of aging. Weight-bearing exercise, proper calcium and vitamin D intake, and a healthy diet all help to minimize the normal bone density loss.
msmarco_passage_65_358747109	Because of this constant creation and depletion of bone tissue, we can think of bone as a bank account. During our early years, we make more bone tissue “deposits” than “withdraws,” increasing bone strength and density. Between ages 25 and 30, our bones reach their maximum strength and density. This is referred to as peak bone mass.
msmarco_passage_65_358747608	At this point, old bone begins breaking down slightly faster than new bone can form, causing bone to lose more bone mass than gain. Because of this, building up your “bone bank” from a young age is critical to preventing bone breaks, fractures and other bone conditions, such as osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_65_387801094	In childhood and adolescence, most of our bone growth and bone density occurs. Girls reach their maximum bone density by age 18. For boys, this occurs by age 20. In adulthood, it is important to maintain bone density and try to slow the rate of bone loss. As we grow older, our bodies lose bone density.
msmarco_passage_65_397444052	After age 30, the rate at which your bone tissue dissolves and is absorbed by the body slowly increases, while the rate of bone building decreases. So overall you lose a small amount of bone each year after age 30.

Recipient of the Excellence in Geriatric Pharmacy Practice Award from the Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy. US Pharm. 2010;35 (9):24-30. Aging causes muscle mass and muscle strength to decrease. 1 By age 75 years, approximately 50% of an individual's total muscle mass has vanished. 2 This age-related reduction in skeletal muscle mass is referred to as sarcopenia. 3 But the process by which skeletal muscle mass progressively decreases, and thus lean body mass as well, begins occurring many years earlier--at about age 35 ( TABLE 1 ). 2,4.
msmarco_passage_66_483558091	There is some good news: CDC's data suggest that your weight probably will not increase indefinitely. The rate of increase starts to slow in the 30s and 40s, and plateaus in your 50s. Story continues below advertisement. After that, the average weight falls.
msmarco_passage_66_54374310	Aging. After reaching peak bone mass, both men and women will start to lose bone tissue as they age. In women, age-related bone loss starts in their early to mid-30s. 11 ﻿ This process is heightened by rapid decreases in estrogen as women enter menopause. Gradual bone loss is not unusual with aging, but women tend to be younger when they start to lose bone.
msmarco_passage_66_702392512	Until about age 30, people normally build more bone than they lose. During the aging process, bone breakdown begins to outpace bone buildup, resulting in a gradual loss of bone mass. Once this loss of bone reaches a certain point, a person has osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_66_708474825	Bone Mass and Osteopenia. Bone mass is the amount of bone you have. Usually, bone mass peaks around age 30. Then bone mass begins to decline. Bone is reabsorbed by your body faster than new bone can be made.
msmarco_passage_66_708607265	That's exactly what your bones have to do. They’re at their strongest around age 30, after which they gradually lose minerals. So children, teenagers, and young adults are building bone that must last the rest of their lives. That means it’s never too early to think about protecting yourself from osteoporosis.
msmarco_passage_66_708619074	Age. Your bone density peaks around age 30. After that, you’ll begin to lose bone mass. So that’s all the more reason to do strength training and weight-bearing exercise -- and make sure you get enough calcium and vitamin D from your diet -- to keep your bones as strong as possible as you get older. Gender.
msmarco_passage_66_708653913	For most women, the total amount of bone peaks somewhere between ages 25 and 30. It may peak even sooner for some women, depending on their risk factors for osteoporosis. When the total amount of bone peaks, the tide turns. At some point, usually around age 35, women start to lose bone. While some bone is lost each year, the rate of bone loss increases dramatically in the five to 10 years after menopause.
msmarco_passage_66_708680299	During childhood, your bones become larger and stronger. Peak bone mass happens when you have the most bone you will ever have, usually in your early to mid-30s. At a certain age, the bone remodeling process changes. New bone comes in at a slower rate. This slowdown leads to a drop in the amount of bone you have.
msmarco_passage_66_708873143	Continued. Bone loss -- where bone breakdown goes faster than bone buildup -- usually begins in the mid-30s. Bones begin to lose calcium -- the mineral that makes them hard -- faster than they can replace it. Less bone remodeling takes place and the bones begin to thin.
msmarco_passage_68_17940475	This is because women begin to lose bone mass as early as age 30 but fractures resulting from osteoporosis don't occur until 10 to 15 years after menopause. Cardiovascular disease — Before menopause, women have lower rates of heart attack and stroke than men.
msmarco_passage_68_48591780	But once you hit your 20s, that process begins to slow down as you reach adulthood. By the time you’re 30, you’ll likely have reached your peak bone mass. The higher your bone mass at its peak, the less likely you are to lose too much of that mass as you age.

msmarco_passage_00_811362170	In general, when a tenant's dog injures someone, courts hold the  landlord liable only if the landlord: knew the dog was dangerous and could have had the dog removed; or. "harbored" or "kept" the tenant's dog - that is, cared for or had some  control over the dog. These factors are discussed just below. They apply to homeowners'  associations, which control common areas in their developments, as well as  traditional landlords. 34.
msmarco_passage_00_811362771	37. But not all states use this rule. Under some laws, landlords are not  liable even when they know a tenant's dog is likely to hurt someone. A  Montana rancher, for example, knew that a dog belonging to his foreman  (who lived on the rancher's property) had bitten someone.
msmarco_passage_00_811364025	In practice, that means the  landlord must know that the dog has already threatened or injured someone. For example, a landlord who knows only that a tenant's dog is kept  chained and barks at people who approach probably will not be held liable  if the dog bites someone.
msmarco_passage_01_612250505	If a tenant breaks a lease or damages the apartment, furniture or appliances, the landlord has some financial compensation. If you are a good tenant who did none of these things, you are entitled to a full refund of your security deposit when you move out.

msmarco_passage_00_340311683	Graph the results placing light intensity on the x-axis. Explanation. Light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is converted to ATP and H+. At very low light levels the plant will be respiring only not photosynthesising. As the light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases.
msmarco_passage_00_340312135	However, the rate will not increase beyond a certain level of light intensity. At high light intensities the rate becomes constant, even with further increases in light intensity, there are no increases in the rate.
msmarco_passage_00_340332103	As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis will increase, until the plant is photosynthesising as fast as it can. At this point, even if light becomes brighter, the plant cannot photosynthesise any faster. Over the first part of the curve ( between A and B ), light is a limiting factor. The plant is limited in how fast it can photosynthesise because it does not have enough light.
msmarco_passage_00_340332644	Between B and C, light is not a limiting factor. Even if more light is shone on the plant, it still cannot photosynthesise any faster. Carbon dioxide. In photosynthesis CO2 is a key limiting factor. The usual atmospheric level of CO2 is 0.03%.
msmarco_passage_00_343070928	During the day, the limiting factor is likely to switch to the temperature or the carbon dioxide concentration as the light intensity increases. Effects of changes in light intensity, CO2, H2O and temperature on the rate of photosynthesis. 1. Light intensity.
msmarco_passage_01_153812116	Carbon dioxide, a key reactant in photosynthesis, is present in the atmosphere at a concentration of about 400 ppm. Most plants require the stomata to be open during daytime. The air spaces in the leaf are saturated with water vapour, which exits the leaf through the stomata in a process known as transpiration.
msmarco_passage_01_685625468	3.8.8 Outline the effects of temperature, light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration on the rate of photosynthesis. As temperature increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases more and more steeply until the optimum temperature is reached.
msmarco_passage_01_685625846	If temperature keeps increasing above the optimum temperature then photosynthesis starts to decrease very rapidly. As light intensity increases so does photosynthesis until a certain point. At a high light intensities photosynthesis reaches a plateau and so does not increase any more.
msmarco_passage_01_685626555	At low and medium light intensity the rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to the light intensity. As the carbon dioxide concentration increases so does the rate of photosynthesis. There is no photosynthesis at very low levels of carbon dioxide and at high levels the rate reaches a plateau.
msmarco_passage_01_685634520	8.2.8 Explain the concept of limiting factors in photosynthesis, with reference to light intensity, temperature and concentration of carbon dioxide. A limiting factor is a factor that controls a process. Light intensity, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration are all factors which can control the rate of photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_02_447608795	Without glucose, cells cannot create ATP, and eventually die. In plants, a process called photosynthesis takes light energy from the sun and uses it to combine carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2 O) to create glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ). This means that to survive, all they need is light, air and water.
msmarco_passage_02_808357053	As carbon dioxide concentration increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases. At high concentrations, the rate of photosynthesis begins to level out due to factors not related to carbon dioxide concentration. One reason might be that some of the enzymes of photosynthesis are working at their maximum rate.
msmarco_passage_02_818303577	These sugars are then used by the plant as energy for any number of things. The process of photosynthesis requires three things: Light, Carbon dioxide and water. If any one of these things is in short supply, then photosynthesis cannot happen. When you increase the level of light, plants will photosynthesize more.
msmarco_passage_02_818305809	Photosynthesis needs water, carbon dioxide, chlorophyll, light, and the right temperature. Light is an extremely important factor for the process. If there is enough water, carbon dioxide, and the temperature is right, light becomes the factor which will affect photosynthesis. Most of the time, when the intensity of light is high, you will get a a greater rate of photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_02_861308895	The students will learn specific concepts during the activity. The students will learn that: 1) the variables of light intensity, temperature, carbon dioxide, light quality all influence the rate of photosynthesis. 2) photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide to furnish the carbon required to make glucose. This carbon dioxide will be supplied by sodium bicarbonate dissolved in the water with the plant leaf disks.
msmarco_passage_03_144207403	Intensity of Light. When there is not enough light, a plant cannot carry out the process of photosynthesis efficiently, it does not matter that there is enough water and carbon dioxide in the environment. Therefore, increasing the intensity of the light will immediately increase the speed of the photosynthesis process.
msmarco_passage_03_144207865	Concentration of Carbon Dioxide. In some particular cases the process of photosynthesis is restricted due to the amount of concentration of CO 2 in the air. Even if there is a lot of sunlight and water, a plant cannot carry out photosynthesis without there being enough carbon dioxide in the air.
msmarco_passage_03_152780110	Greater light intensity leads to higher photosynthesis rates, as does increased carbon dioxide concentration. However, once light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration reach a certain level, photosynthesis rates level off and don't increase much further.
msmarco_passage_03_300912139	Looking to the leaves. Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air, combine it with water and light, and make carbohydrates — the process known as photosynthesis. It is well established that as CO 2 in the atmosphere increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases. This is known as the CO 2 fertilisation effect.
msmarco_passage_03_534444372	The Light Saturation Point. At a particular light intensity, the so-called "light saturation point", the rate of O 2 evolution levels off. Any further increase in the amount of light striking the leaf does not cause an increase in the rate of photosynthesis--the amount of light is said to be 'saturating' for the photosynthetic process. 6. Why does the rate of photosynthesis level off at a particular light level called the "light saturation point?".
msmarco_passage_03_692818098	of photosynthesis decreases. · Carbon dioxide concentration- if the percentage of carbon dioxide in. the atmosphere increases, so does the rate of photosynthesis. · Temperature- if the temperature increases, then the rate of. photosynthesis also increases, (however, temperatures above 40OC can.
msmarco_passage_03_692831566	Furthermore, I predict that if the light. intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis will increase at a. proportional rate and more oxygen will be produced and therefore the. oxygen levels will increase. However, the lower the light intensity, less oxygen will be produced which would affect this investigation.
msmarco_passage_03_693261078	of photosynthesis will stay the same when it reaches a certain point. I think this because the plant may use up all of the carbon dioxide. (Sodium hydro carbonate) and the plant can have as much light as it. needs but if it does not have any carbon dioxide it will not be able. to photosynthesise.

The increase in light intensity increases the rate ofphotosynthesis but, once it reaches the light saturation point therate of photosynthesis decreases.
msmarco_passage_04_142350310	Decreases when the inflation rate increases. Why does the rate of photosynthesis increase and then reach a plateau as the concentration of CO2 around a plant increases? As the rate of photosynthesis increases and it reaches aplateau, the lights intensity or CO2 concentration increases.
msmarco_passage_04_153997385	When the intensity increase number of electrons ejected isincreased. But there is no change in energy or velocity. Does the rate of photosynthesis increase as the intensity of light increases? no photosynthesis works inside the plant not the intensity ofthe light.
msmarco_passage_04_153998250	No, it doesn't. Increasing the intensity of light increases therate of photosynthesis. How does light intensity effect photosynthesis? If the light intensity is increased, the rate of photosynthesisincreases.If the light intensity is increased, the rate ofphotosynthesis increases.

msmarco_passage_04_17358858	Light. Another common reason that plants’ leaves turn yellow is because not enough light is reaching the plant. This occurs because the rate of photosynthesis is limited in low light, but as the light is increased, photosynthesis increases as well.
msmarco_passage_04_183136352	Carbon dioxide is needed by plants for photosynthesis, their method for obtaining food.Increased CO2 levels increase the rate of diffusion of carbon dioxide into cells for photosynthesis, they also need water. To speed the rate that water gets into the leaves increase the temperature, this increases the rate of transpiration so the water travels up the plant faster.
msmarco_passage_04_195584667	Where are reactants and products in photosynthesis? The reactants of photosynthesis are sun light, carbon dioxide, and water. The products of photosynthesis are carbohydrates, ATP, and sugars.
msmarco_passage_04_441115507	Light intensity. Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly - even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide and a suitable temperature. Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor – a limiting factor – becomes in short supply. previous.
msmarco_passage_04_441115984	Carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon dioxide – with water – is one of the reactants in photosynthesis. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase. Again, at some point, a factor may become limiting.
msmarco_passage_04_441187031	Factors affecting photosynthesis - light intensity. There are several ways of measuring the rate of photosynthesis in the lab. These include: the rate of oxygen production (number of bubbles or volume of oxygen gas given off in a set time) the rate of carbon dioxide uptake. the rate of glucose production. Several factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis:
msmarco_passage_04_441187572	Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor - a limiting factor - becomes in short supply. The rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to the light intensity until another factor becomes limiting.
msmarco_passage_04_441187954	Photosynthesis. Green plants and algae use light energy to make glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and light intensity can affect the rate of photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_04_441292703	Several factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis: light intensity. carbon dioxide concentration. temperature. The amount of chlorophyll also affects the rate of photosynthesis: plants in lighting conditions unfavourable for photosynthesis synthesise more chlorophyll, to absorb the light required.
msmarco_passage_04_441293182	Light intensity. Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly - even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide and a suitable temperature. Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor - a limiting factor - becomes in short supply. previous.
msmarco_passage_04_441293649	Carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon dioxide – with water – is one of the reactants in photosynthesis. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase.
msmarco_passage_04_441294007	Again, at some point, a different factor may become limiting. Beyond this concentration, further increases in the concentration of carbon dioxide will not result in a faster rate of photosynthesis, and would appear on a graph as a horizontal line.
msmarco_passage_04_441327306	Several factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis: light intensity. carbon dioxide concentration. temperature. The amount of chlorophyll also affects the rate of photosynthesis: plants in lighting conditions unfavourable for photosynthesis may synthesise more chlorophyll, to absorb the light required.

msmarco_passage_04_441328795	Carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon dioxide - with water - is one of the reactants in photosynthesis. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase. Again, at some point, a factor may become limiting.
msmarco_passage_04_441331315	An excess is the same as a negative uptake. As the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis follows (point B on the graph). This means more carbon dioxide is being absorbed by the plant for photosynthesis. So this means more carbon dioxide uptake occurs.
msmarco_passage_04_441332185	Beyond the compensation point, further increases in light intensity cause an increase in photosynthesis. This means the rate of photosynthesis increases beyond the rate of respiration (point D). Now more carbon dioxide is being taken in by the plant for photosynthesis than is produced by the plant during respiration.
msmarco_passage_04_441332644	So the carbon dioxide uptake increases. After a specific point, further increases in light intensity give ever smaller increases in photosynthesis. This results in the rate of carbon dioxide uptake slowing (point E on the graph). A similar graph will be obtained if oxygen production is plotted against light intensity.
msmarco_passage_04_441727174	Several factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis: light intensity. carbon dioxide concentration. temperature.

msmarco_passage_04_441730262	The line does not go through the origin. This is because oxygen production and carbon dioxide uptake are affected by respiration as well as photosynthesis. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Below is a graph measuring the rate of photosynthesis plotted on carbon dioxide against light intensity:
msmarco_passage_04_441730728	This graph shows that with no light, the carbon dioxide uptake is below zero (point A on the graph). With no light, there is no photosynthesis. So the rate of respiration is greater than the rate of photosynthesis. So this means there is an overall excess of carbon dioxide produced during respiration.
msmarco_passage_04_441731183	An excess is the same as a negative uptake. As the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis follows (point B on the graph). This means more carbon dioxide is being absorbed by the plant for photosynthesis. So this means more carbon dioxide uptake occurs.
msmarco_passage_04_441732053	Beyond the compensation point, further increases in light intensity cause an increase in photosynthesis. This means the rate of photosynthesis increases beyond the rate of respiration (point D).

msmarco_passage_04_564923670	The three main limiting factors of photosynthesis are light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. 31. The rate at which photosynthesis takes place varies depending on the intensity of light energy.
msmarco_passage_04_567614740	This indicates that photosynthesis increases. Sodium bicarbonate is added for increasing the amount of CO 2 in the water and so it can be concluded that the rate of photosynthesis increases by increasing the quantity of CO 2, but only till the light or some other factor starts to act as a limiting factor.
msmarco_passage_04_568512999	Factor # 4. Intensity: When CO 2 and temperature are not limiting and light intensities are low, the rate of photosynthesis increases with an increase in its intensity. At a point saturation may be reached, when further increase in light intensity fails to induce increase in photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_04_568517392	If the concentration of CO 2 is raised still further, the rate of photosynthesis does not increase since light is now the limiting factor. When the light intensity is increased, then a higher concentration of CO 2 will be decomposed and the rate of photosynthesis increases till light again becomes a limiting factor.
msmarco_passage_04_90577144	Fifty percent of a tree by weight is carbon. Thus, if the number of trees is increased, more CO2 will be consumed and the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will reduce. A: Plants reduce the CO2, because they use it with photosynthesis. The CO2 level is going up, and chopping trees is one of its main reasons.
msmarco_passage_04_93659698	Water, light, Carbon Dioxide, and temperature. How does carbon dioxide concentration affect photosynthesis? Carbon dioxide is an essential reactant for photosynthesis tooccur. If there is a higher concentration of carbon dioxide, thenthe rate of photosynthesis will increase, and vise versa.

msmarco_passage_06_210604715	Even though it forms about .04% of the air, it is a needed factor in light-independent photosynthesis. In higher concentrations, more carbon is incorporated into carbohydrates, therefore increasing the rate of photosynthesis in light-independent reactions.
msmarco_passage_07_828985971	If I was to extent this investigation I would try to see how other variable can affect the rate of the bubbles being produces: For example, if I wanted the see how carbon dioxide concentration affected the rate of photosynthesis then I would use different concentration of carbonated water and look for any changes.
msmarco_passage_08_722008845	3. Carbon Dioxide. Carbon dioxide is used to make sugar in the photosynthesis reaction. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere varies between 0.03% and 0.04%. An increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide gives an increase in the rate of photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_08_722009286	It is difficult to do this out in the open air but is possible in a greenhouse. The rate of photosynthesis increases linearly with increasing carbon dioxide concentration (from point A to B on the graph). Gradually the rate falls of and at a certain carbon dioxide concentration the rate of photosynthesis stays constant (from point B to C on the graph).
msmarco_passage_08_722009775	Here a rise in carbon dioxide levels has no affect on the rate of photosynthesis as the other factors such as light intensity become limiting. Many crops such as tomatoes and lettuce give higher yield when grown in greenhouses.
msmarco_passage_11_207379901	Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is fairly constant at about 0.03 to 0.04 percent and does not strongly influence the rate of photosynthesis, except under unusual conditions of high water availability and full or nearly full sunlight, when CO 2 is limiting (Meyer, Anderson, and Bohning 1960).
msmarco_passage_11_309018420	Cannabis plants need high CO2 levels and light to perform photosynthesis, which is done through the stomatas. An increased amount of CO2 in the grow room will allow your plant to perform photosynthesis faster, absorbing more light and nutrients, resulting in faster growth and in bigger yield because the buds develop denser.
msmarco_passage_11_711431755	As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis initially increases and then levels off to a plateau. CO2 Levels: Increasing the level of CO 2 stimulates photosynthesis until the rate reaches a plateau. Temperature: Raising the temperature accelerates the chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_11_714963527	This occurs in several complex steps, photosynthesis is a rate limited reaction, depends on several factors including carbon dioxide concentration, ambient temperature and light intensity; the energy is retrieved from photons, I.e. particles of light, and water is used as a reducing agent.

msmarco_passage_13_398190899	Graph the results placing light intensity on the x-axis. Explanation. Light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is converted to ATP and H+. At very low light levels the plant will be respiring only not photosynthesising. As the light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases.
msmarco_passage_13_398191352	However, the rate will not increase beyond a certain level of light intensity. At high light intensities the rate becomes constant, even with further increases in light intensity, there are no increases in the rate.
msmarco_passage_13_398205610	As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis will increase, until the plant is photosynthesising as fast as it can. At this point, even if light becomes brighter, the plant cannot photosynthesise any faster. Over the first part of the curve ( between A and B ), light is a limiting factor. The plant is limited in how fast it can photosynthesise because it does not have enough light.
msmarco_passage_13_398206152	Between B and C, light is not a limiting factor. Even if more light is shone on the plant, it still cannot photosynthesise any faster. Carbon dioxide. In photosynthesis CO2 is a key limiting factor. The usual atmospheric level of CO2 is 0.03%.

msmarco_passage_22_461390815	Click to see full answer. Also asked, how does temperature affect photosynthesis and transpiration? Increased light intensity will increase the rate of photosynthesis so more water is drawn into the leaves where photosynthesis primarily takes place and therefore the rate of transpiration is greater. Increased temperature increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules and hence they are removed more quickly.

msmarco_passage_23_556603636	For example, when greenhouses are closed during the winter and filled with crops, CO 2 is used by plants and the concentration becomes low, perhaps as low as 200 ppm. As Figure 1 illustrates, a low CO 2 concentration has two consequences: photosynthesis is reduced and the light saturation point is decreased. (The light saturation point is the intensity at which additional increases in light do not increase photosynthesis.)
msmarco_passage_23_556604204	Photosynthesis increases as CO 2 increases until some saturating concentration, which is typically around 1,000 ppm. Enriching the air with CO 2 enables plants to more effectively utilize light, resulting in an increase in the light saturation point.

A limiting factor is a factor that controls a process. Light intensity, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration are all factors which can control the rate of photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_25_259221438	If temperature keeps increasing above the optimum temperature then photosynthesis starts to decrease very rapidly. As light intensity increases so does photosynthesis until a certain point. At a high light intensities photosynthesis reaches a plateau and so does not increase any more.
msmarco_passage_25_259222145	At low and medium light intensity the rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to the light intensity.

msmarco_passage_30_795590421	Increasing the light intensity will boost the speed of photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide concentration: Sometimes photosynthesis is limited by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. Even if there is plenty of light, a plant cannot photosynthesize if there is insufficient carbon dioxide.
msmarco_passage_31_866472527	The Rate of Photosynthesis. The four key factors affecting the rate of photosynthesis are: Chlorophyll concentration - High chlorophyll concentration gives a high rate of photosynthesis. Light intensity - Increasing light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis because more energy is provided. However, if the light intensity is increased above a certain threshold, the rate of photosynthesis will not increase because another factor (such as temperature) is limiting the rate of the reaction.
msmarco_passage_31_866473184	Carbon dioxide concentration - Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increases the rate of photosynthesis because carbon dioxide is a reactant in photosynthesis. However, above a certain threshold, further increases in the carbon dioxide concentration do not increase the rate of photosynthesis because another factor (such as light intensity) is limiting the rate of reaction.
msmarco_passage_32_476056771	Thus, the plant reaches a "light saturation point" and the rate of photosynthesis is limited due to a limited amount of carbon dioxide, or due to some other limiting factor. The following image provides more nuance. It shows that light intensity and the rate of photosynthesis increase with one another. It also shows that the rate at which photosynthesis levels out is dependent upon other factors—both plants in 0.1% CO₂, they cannot photosynthesize at nearly the rate of the plants in 0.4% CO₂.
msmarco_passage_32_636159244	Connection to Class Content: When we learned about photosynthesis, we learned that there are specific reactants needed to start the process. One of those reactants is carbon dioxide. If carbon dioxide is not present, then photosynthesis cannot occur.
msmarco_passage_33_110712384	Intensity of Light. When there is not enough light, a plant cannot carry out the process of photosynthesis efficiently, it does not matter that there is enough water and carbon dioxide in the environment. Therefore, increasing the intensity of the light will immediately increase the speed of the photosynthesis process.
msmarco_passage_33_110712846	Concentration of Carbon Dioxide. In some particular cases the process of photosynthesis is restricted due to the amount of concentration of CO 2 in the air. Even if there is a lot of sunlight and water, a plant cannot carry out photosynthesis without there being enough carbon dioxide in the air.
msmarco_passage_33_144893267	Increasing light intensity increased the amount of light energy available for light-dependent reactions to occur. (textbook) Therefore, the greater the light intensity, the greater the rate of photosynthesis. Above a certain light intensity, though, the rate of photosynthesis remained constant. This occurred because there was a limit to the rate of photosynthesis possible.
msmarco_passage_33_144893781	With limited water, enzymes, and other reagents of photosynthesis, increasing light intensity could eventually no longer increase rate of photosynthesis.The experiment was limited by the large range of light intensities used and the long time intervals at which measurements were taken.
msmarco_passage_33_144897432	In this experiment, spinach leaves were subjected to varying light intensities to determine the effect of light intensity on rate of photosynthesis as measured by production of oxygen. We expected rate of photosynthesis to increase with increasing light intensity. This was because increasing light intensity would increase the amount of energy available for the light dependent photosynthetic reactions.
msmarco_passage_33_144897975	However, the increasing rate of photosynthesis was predicted to eventually level off with increasing light intensity because when light intensity was no longer a limiting factor of photosynthetic rate, other factors such as amount of water and CO2 became limiting. Therefore, a maximum rate of photosynthesis was reached at a level of “light intensity saturation.” (textbook)Materials and Methods:This investigation involved determining the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis as measured by rate of oxygen production of spinach leaves.

It is well established that as CO 2 in the atmosphere increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases. This is known as the CO 2 fertilisation effect.
msmarco_passage_35_331168750	5 Answers. Relevance. science teacher. Lv 7. 1 decade ago. Favourite answer. The rate of photosynthesis does not necessarily increase, except for the effect of increased temperature. A greenhouse allows sunlight through, but does not allow the infrared that is reflected to escape, so the temperature inside rises and can let plants have a longer growing season.
msmarco_passage_35_331170254	Bright lights also provide a higher-than-normal light intensity. The use of artificial heating allows photosynthesis to continue at an increased rate. The use of additional carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere inside the greenhouse also allows photosynthesis to continue at an increased rate. However, the additional cost of providing extra lighting, heat and carbon dioxide has to be weighed against the increased crop yield and the extra income it will provide.

However, the lower the light intensity, less oxygen will be produced which would affect this investigation.
msmarco_passage_37_712545587	Light. Another common reason that plants’ leaves turn yellow is because not enough light is reaching the plant. This occurs because the rate of photosynthesis is limited in low light, but as the light is increased, photosynthesis increases as well.
msmarco_passage_38_55098899	It increases. Why does the rate of photosynthesis increase and then reach a plateau as the concentration of CO2 around a plant increases? As the rate of photosynthesis increases and it reaches aplateau, the lights intensity or CO2 concentration increases.
msmarco_passage_38_55099740	Increasing the intensity of light increases therate of photosynthesis. How does carbon dioxide effect the rate of photosynthesis? Too much can decrease the rate of Photosynthesis... Apparently..&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;Plants NEED CO2 to conduct photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_38_55100158	Increasing CO2increases the rate of photosynthesis- to a point. How does increasing light intensity affect the rate of photosynthesis? The increase in light intensity increases the rate ofphotosynthesis but, once it reaches the light saturation point therate of photosynthesis decreases.
msmarco_passage_38_55101745	This is because there is a 'light dependantreaction' as part of photosynthesis, and therefore photosynthesiscan only happen when there is enough light. CO2 is needed for photosynthesis. The more co2, the faster therate of photosynthesis. Increasing the Temperature increases the rate.
msmarco_passage_38_55103045	As light intensity increases then the rate of photosynthesisincreases until a point is reached when the rate levels off. Beyondthis point is called the light saturation point ofphotosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_38_803897286	In this experiment the rate of photosynthesis is measured by timing how long it takes photosynthesis to occur in ten leaf disks that are in a solution of carbon dioxide. The prediction for this experiment was that if a plant receives more light, then it will have a higher rate of photosynthesis. The data supports.
msmarco_passage_38_817743845	In this experiment the rate of photosynthesis is measured by timing how long it takes photosynthesis to occur in ten leaf disks that are in a solution of carbon dioxide. The prediction for this experiment was that if a plant receives more light, then it will have a higher rate of photosynthesis. The data supports.
msmarco_passage_38_817748294	The relationship between light, plant growth and photosynthesis is extremely important because if there is no light, photosynthesis will not take place however limiting the plants growth. Light can limit the whole reaction of photosynthesis if it’s not present no matter how the temperature and carbon dioxide is increased, photosynthesis will still not occur.
msmarco_passage_38_866202647	Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor - a limiting factor - becomes in short supply. The rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to the light intensity until another factor becomes limiting.
msmarco_passage_38_866203030	Photosynthesis. Green plants and algae use light energy to make glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and light intensity can affect the rate of photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_38_866203380	Carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon dioxide is one of the reactants in photosynthesis. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase. At some point, another factor may become limiting and this is shown by the plateau (flattened section) of the graph.
msmarco_passage_38_866327805	Light. As light intensity increases so too does the rate of photosynthesis until a certain point where the graph levels off. At lower light intensities, light is the limiting factor because an increase in light causes an increase in photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_38_866328621	Carbon dioxide. As carbon dioxide concentrations increase, so too does the rate of photosynthesis until a certain point where the graph levels off. At lower carbon dioxide concentrations carbon dioxide is the limiting factor because an increase in carbon dioxide causes an increase in photosynthesis. At higher carbon dioxide concentrations (plateau of graph), further increasing the carbon dioxide concentration does not increase the rate of photosynthesis meaning another factor is limiting photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_38_866851484	Light intensity. Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly - even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide and a suitable temperature. Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor - a limiting factor - becomes in short supply. previous.
msmarco_passage_38_866851952	Carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon dioxide – with water – is one of the reactants in photosynthesis. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase.
msmarco_passage_38_866852311	Again, at some point, a different factor may become limiting. Beyond this concentration, further increases in the concentration of carbon dioxide will not result in a faster rate of photosynthesis, and would appear on a graph as a horizontal line.
msmarco_passage_38_867365033	Temperature. It is useful to be able to interpret a graph like the example below. This graph shows the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis at two different carbon dioxide concentrations. Light intensity is limiting the rate of photosynthesis at light intensities of 0 to 3.75 units. As light intensity is increased the rate of photosynthesis increases.
msmarco_passage_38_867365571	At light intensities of 3.75 to 5.5, a carbon dioxide concentration of 0.03 per cent is insufficient and limits the rate of photosynthesis. A carbon dioxide concentration of 0.1 per cent is sufficient and the rate of photosynthesis continues to increase as light intensity increases.
msmarco_passage_38_867365984	At light intensities of 5.5 units and above, a carbon dioxide concentration of 0.1 per cent is limiting and the rate of photosynthesis does not increase even when light intensity is increased. Light intensity is not limiting the rate of photosynthesis at light intensities of five to eight units. As light intensity is increased the rate of photosynthesis remains the same.
msmarco_passage_38_867366499	At light intensities of five to eight units carbon dioxide concentration is limiting the rate of photosynthesis. If the light intensity is kept the same, and the carbon dioxide concentration is increased from 0.03 per cent to 0.10 per cent then the rate of photosynthesis increases. previous. 1.
msmarco_passage_38_867806016	Light. As light intensity increases so too does the rate of photosynthesis until a certain point where the graph levels off. At lower light intensities, light is the limiting factor because an increase in light causes an increase in photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_38_867806832	Carbon dioxide. As carbon dioxide concentrations increase, so too does the rate of photosynthesis until a certain point where the graph levels off. At lower carbon dioxide concentrations carbon dioxide is the limiting factor because an increase in carbon dioxide causes an increase in photosynthesis. At higher carbon dioxide concentrations (plateau of graph), further increasing the carbon dioxide concentration does not increase the rate of photosynthesis meaning another factor is limiting photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_38_868533273	Rate of photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis is affected by the following factors: concentration of carbon dioxide. availability of water. light intensity. The rate of photosynthesis is also affected by temperature because the reactions of photosynthesis are controlled by specific enzymes.
msmarco_passage_38_868533735	At low temperatures photosynthesis happens more slowly. A limiting factor is a factor that can limit the rate of photosynthesis if it is in short supply. A greenhouse can be used to overcome the limiting factors of photosynthesis. This allows plants to grow faster as they are making more food.
msmarco_passage_38_868534175	Greenhouses can have artificial light so that photosynthesis can continue beyond daylight hours, or at a higher than normal light intensity. The use of paraffin lamps inside a greenhouse increases the rate of photosynthesis because the burning paraffin produces carbon dioxide as well as heat. previous. 1. 2.
msmarco_passage_38_870112799	Light intensity. Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly - even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide and a suitable temperature. Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor – a limiting factor – becomes in short supply. previous.
msmarco_passage_38_870113277	Carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon dioxide – with water – is one of the reactants in photosynthesis. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase. Again, at some point, a factor may become limiting.
msmarco_passage_39_1330431	Several factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis: light intensity. carbon dioxide concentration. temperature. The amount of chlorophyll also affects the rate of photosynthesis: plants in lighting conditions unfavourable for photosynthesis may synthesise more chlorophyll, to absorb the light required.
msmarco_passage_39_1330913	Light intensity. Without enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly - even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide and a suitable temperature. Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis , until some other factor - a limiting factor - becomes in short supply. previous.
msmarco_passage_39_1331380	next. previous. next. At low light intensities the increase in the rate of photosynthesis is linear. previous. next. At some point a factor becomes limiting. For instance, if carbon dioxide becomes the limiting factor the supply of carbon dioxide is not sufficient to keep pace with the increasing rate of reaction. previous.
msmarco_passage_39_1331917	Carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon dioxide - with water - is one of the reactants in photosynthesis. If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase. Again, at some point, a factor may become limiting.
msmarco_passage_39_1333512	The line does not go through the origin. This is because oxygen production and carbon dioxide uptake are affected by respiration as well as photosynthesis. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Below is a graph measuring the rate of photosynthesis plotted on carbon dioxide against light intensity:
msmarco_passage_39_1333977	This graph shows that with no light, the carbon dioxide uptake is below zero (point A on the graph). With no light, there is no photosynthesis. So the rate of respiration is greater than the rate of photosynthesis. So this means there is an overall excess of carbon dioxide produced during respiration.
msmarco_passage_39_1334431	An excess is the same as a negative uptake. As the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis follows (point B on the graph). This means more carbon dioxide is being absorbed by the plant for photosynthesis. So this means more carbon dioxide uptake occurs.
msmarco_passage_39_1335299	Beyond the compensation point, further increases in light intensity cause an increase in photosynthesis. This means the rate of photosynthesis increases beyond the rate of respiration (point D). Now more carbon dioxide is being taken in by the plant for photosynthesis than is produced by the plant during respiration.
msmarco_passage_39_1335757	So the carbon dioxide uptake increases. After a specific point, further increases in light intensity give ever smaller increases in photosynthesis. This results in the rate of carbon dioxide uptake slowing (point E on the graph). A similar graph will be obtained if oxygen production is plotted against light intensity.
msmarco_passage_39_507047522	The three main limiting factors of photosynthesis are light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. 31. The rate at which photosynthesis takes place varies depending on the intensity of light energy.
msmarco_passage_39_510987690	This indicates that photosynthesis increases. Sodium bicarbonate is added for increasing the amount of CO 2 in the water and so it can be concluded that the rate of photosynthesis increases by increasing the quantity of CO 2, but only till the light or some other factor starts to act as a limiting factor.
msmarco_passage_39_513964947	Light: A study of the effect of light on the rate and quantity of photosynthesis would have to include light reflected, absorbed and transmitted; intensity, quality and duration of available light, and destructive effects of light.
msmarco_passage_39_513965303	Light Intensity: There may be a direct relationship between the rate of photosynthesis and the intensity of light, provided that no other factor is limiting. For example, on bright sunny days the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere is usually the limiting factor, not light intensity.
msmarco_passage_39_513965739	However, on cloudy days light may be the limiting factor. Heinicke and Childers (1937) have found that the rate of photosynthesis steadily increased with light intensity up to about full sunlight even through saturation intensity for a single exposed leaf would be sufficiently lower.
msmarco_passage_39_513966152	The need for higher light intensities for maximum photosynthesis of an entire tree is due to partial illumination of the inner leaves. ADVERTISEMENTS: Both quality and intensity of light influence photosynthesis. Light between wavelength of 400 nm and 700 nm is most effective, for photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_39_513970391	The workers like Kreuslar (1887), Brown and Escombe (1902) and Pantanelli (1903) investigated that there is an increase in the rate of photosynthesis with an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide at the lower levels of carbon dioxide concentrations. A decline in rate was observed in higher concentrations.
msmarco_passage_39_513972213	They are as follows: (i) An inactivation of enzymes at higher temperatures. (ii) The accumulation of the end products of the reaction which may exert a retarding effect on the rate of photosynthesis. (iii) Failure of the diffusion of carbon dioxide toward the chloroplasts to keep pace with its use in photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_39_513972691	Factor # 6. Oxygen Concentration: In most plants, increase in the oxygen concentration results in a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis. The normal atmospheric concentration of oxygen is high enough to induce a lower rate of photosynthesis than obtains at lower concentration of oxygen.
msmarco_passage_39_513973933	The effect of the leaf anatomy upon the rate of photosynthesis is because of influences upon the rate of carbon dioxide entry, upon the light intensity penetrating to chlorenchyma cells, upon the turgidity of leaf cells and upon the rate of translocation of solutes from green cells. Factor # 10. Protoplasmic Factors:
msmarco_passage_39_513980172	Factor # 4. Intensity: When CO 2 and temperature are not limiting and light intensities are low, the rate of photosynthesis increases with an increase in its intensity. At a point saturation may be reached, when further increase in light intensity fails to induce increase in photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_39_513984565	If the concentration of CO 2 is raised still further, the rate of photosynthesis does not increase since light is now the limiting factor. When the light intensity is increased, then a higher concentration of CO 2 will be decomposed and the rate of photosynthesis increases till light again becomes a limiting factor.
msmarco_passage_39_952146	wind can increase the supply of carbon dioxide to plants. but wind increases the rate of transpiration and therefore water loss. wind can cause mechanical damage to plants. carbon dioxide levels for plants: carbon dioxide is required for photosynthesis, so increased concentrations will increase growth and yields.
msmarco_passage_41_625209542	At high temperature, the rate of photosynthesis decreases due to denaturation of enzymes. CO2 : An increase in CO2 concentration upto 1% (0.03% to 1%) causes rate of photosynthesis to increase. Higher CO2 concentration is toxic to plants and also closes stomata.
msmarco_passage_42_11533472	Could planting trees make enough difference to impact increased CO2 levels on a global level? The idea seems simple enough. Since trees and plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) for photosynthesis, theoretically planting enough trees should reduce CO2.
msmarco_passage_44_581740341	Water availability. Namely, the higher the light intensity, temperature, carbon dioxide and chlorophyll concentration, the faster the rate at which photosynthesis occurs. But there is an optimum rate. In the case of light intensity, photosynthesis rate is higher in red or blue light and very low in green light.
msmarco_passage_44_739241741	Higher SNR values mean that the laser spot is more detectable. For visual applications, the closer to 550nm (green) the laser wavelength is, the brighter it will appear. In detector applications, it is beneficial to use filtering to increase your SNR and perhaps utilize a lens to limit field of view.
msmarco_passage_44_772635684	At 400 ppm (same as outside air) photosynthesis increases quickly as the CO2 levels climb. The increase in photosynthesis is more moderate as the CO2 concentration climbs to 800 ppm. The increase is moderate, but significant between 800 and 1200 ppm. CO2 at normal levels is not dangerous.
msmarco_passage_44_772637460	The plant cannot take advantage of higher CO2 levels until the light intensity increases. At a light intensity of 600 mol (4600 fc) (49,310 lux), the photosynthesis rate increases more as CO2 concentration is increased to 400 ppm.
msmarco_passage_44_772637818	The rate of increase declines a bit after that, but the photosynthesis rate continues to increase as CO2 levels reach 600 ppm. Above 600 ppm of CO2, the photosynthesis rate continues to climb but at an even slower rate, until the rate increase levels off at about 1200 ppm.
msmarco_passage_44_772643062	Photosynthesis consists of a complex series of reactions in which light energy is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to sugar, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. photosynthesis and plant growth. The amount of CO2 in the air has a profound effect on the rate of photosynthesis and plant growth. Photosynthesis speeds up as the amount of CO2 in the air increases, as long as there is enough light to power it (to an upper limit).
msmarco_passage_45_165179174	Increase in temperature initiates evaporation of water, leading to a low rate of photosynthesis even in the presence of sunlight and CO2. The concentration of CO2: Concentration of CO2 is required to produce the glucose molecules; hence, higher the CO2 concentration, greater is the rate of photosynthesis.
msmarco_passage_45_223336126	In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN = 4.0).
msmarco_passage_45_227080693	If the light intensity is increased beyond the compensation point, the rate of photosynthesis increases proportionally until the point of light saturation is reached, beyond which the rate of photosynthesis is no longer affected by light intensity. A Dictionary of Biology.
msmarco_passage_45_501984389	Even though it forms about .04% of the air, it is a needed factor in light-independent photosynthesis. In higher concentrations, more carbon is incorporated into carbohydrates, therefore increasing the rate of photosynthesis in light-independent reactions.
msmarco_passage_45_689630684	Red Light. Red light is the second main contributor to photosynthesis, but similarly to blue it produces unique results in plant physiology. Red light exists most when the sun is low in the sky, which is winter, morning and evening.

msmarco_passage_49_384487458	Concentration of Carbon Dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a vital ingredient in the process of photosynthesis. Therefore, if the concentration of CO2 is high, the rate of photosynthesis also increases proportionally. Under normal air-quality circumstances, the concentration of carbon dioxide ranges from 300 to 400 ppm.
msmarco_passage_53_775737144	1. carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide normally present is atmosphere is about 0.039% If the level of carbon dioxide in the environment increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases. But if the level of carbon dioxide increases very much, it may become toxic and rate of photosynthesis decreases.
msmarco_passage_54_756551330	The rate of photosynthesis can be limited by the factors: temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and light intensity (draw graphs of each factor vs rate of photosynthesis). Temperature increases the rate up to a point and then quickly drops off.
msmarco_passage_54_756552012	Light intensity and CO2 concentration increase both cause the rate of photosynthesis to increase while they are the limiting factor, but then plateau once another factor becomes the limiting factor. The rate of transpiration can be affected by: light intensity, air movement, temperature and humidity. Increased light intensity will increase the rate of photosynthesis so more water is drawn into the leaves where photosynthesis primarily takes place and therefore the rate of transpiration is greater.
msmarco_passage_55_723313258	This research could find no association between higher milk consumption and all-cause (or specific) mortality ( 22 ). While these studies are not conclusive (correlation does not equal causation), they suggest that milk is either neutral or possibly good for you.
msmarco_passage_57_736644997	Light saturation point. More light generally equates to higher levels of photosynthesis. However as the light intensity increases, the photosynthetic rate eventually reaches a maximum point. This point where the light intensity does not increase the photosynthesis rate is called the light saturation point.
msmarco_passage_57_861189694	The reason why plants can’t simply capture more energy to increase their rates of photosynthesis is that the energy must be captured in the form of chemical bonds within sugars, so photosynthesis is also limited by the rate of CO2 absorption, and that, in turn, is limited by how much water they have available.
msmarco_passage_58_247619001	Continue Reading. Many external and internal factors affect the rate of photosynthesis. The external or environmental factors at:A light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. The internal factor influencing the photosynthesis is chlorophyll content of the leaves and protoplasmic factors.

msmarco_passage_58_267000323	Thus only about 0.5 to 1.5% of light energy is in photosynthesis. Thus light is not a limiting factor at high intensity. Light is a limiting factor at low intensity. Thus the rate of photosynthesis increases with an increase in light intensity. High light intensities affect the rate of photosynthesis.

msmarco_passage_58_430464126	An increase in the amount of light well increase the amount of photosynthesis, if the light intensity increases the rate of the reaction will increase at a proportional rate until a certain level is reached, the rate of increases will then go down. Other factors affecting the rate of photosynthesis : 1. Temperature. 2.
msmarco_passage_58_463700017	Carbon dioxide is. Photosynthesis is a process by which plants & certain organisms convert the light energy to chemical energy.This process is basically divided into 2 reactions - light dependent reaction & light independent reaction. For the whole process of photosynthesis to occur, 3 important things are required : water, carbon dioxide & light.
msmarco_passage_58_519406230	Carbon dioxide is.

For the whole process of photosynthesis to occur, 3 important things are required : water, carbon dioxide & light.
msmarco_passage_58_519407074	Water then reaches the leaves. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants from the atmosphere through pores present in the leaf which is called as stomata. In order to understand how & where does photosynthesis occur, we need to know about the structure of the leaf in detail (Since leaves are the organ of photosynthesis).
msmarco_passage_58_602408908	The reason why plants can’t simply capture more energy to increase their rates of photosynthesis is that the energy must be captured in the form of chemical bonds within sugars, so photosynthesis is also limited by the rate of CO2 absorption, and that, in turn, is limited by how much water they have available.
msmarco_passage_59_182452684	Besides non-chlorophyll light absorption and lower efficiencie of carotenoids there seems to be an other effect for plants and under low light conditions. The quantum yields of PSII and PSI seem to be more balanced under red light (averaged over 600-700 nm) then under blue light (averaged over 400-500 nm).
msmarco_passage_59_182454067	Alexei Solovchenko. It is a well-known phenomenon that plants (higher plant leaves) may absorb a lot (30% and more) of incident solar radiation in far-red and near-infrared resions of the spectrum (> 700 nm). Obviously, using this energy to drive photosynthesis is complicated (although corresponding hypotheses exist).
msmarco_passage_59_257696700	Carbon dioxide concentration will directly affect the rate of  photosynthesis as it is used in the photosynthesis reaction. It is also  easy to change the amount of carbon dioxide that the plant receives. Light is also directly used in the photosynthesis reaction and is easy  to change in normal lab conditions.
msmarco_passage_59_807787872	Light – the more light there is, the faster photosynthesis occurs. Water – not enough water slows photosynthesis down. Temperature – photosynthesis works best at around 30 degrees Celsius. Levels of carbon dioxide – photosynthesis is faster if there is more carbon dioxide in the air.
msmarco_passage_60_226415364	Temperature: Warmer the temperature, higher the rate of photosynthesis. The rate is highest between the temperatures of 25° to 35° C, after which it starts to decrease. Concentration of Carbon dioxide: Higher concentration of carbon dioxide increases the rate of photosynthesis until it reaches a certain point, beyond which no further effects are found.
msmarco_passage_60_281816450	are ionised the energy in the radiation is reduced, and even though the gas density is. higher at lower altitudes the degree of ionisation becomes less because of the reduction of. the level of ultraviolet light. At the lower levels of the ionosphere where the intensity of the ultraviolet light has been.
msmarco_passage_60_38598813	For example, leaves on trees overhanging forest streams strongly absorb red and blue wavelengths in addition to reducing total PAR (e.g., Federer and Tanner, 1966 ), resulting in green light that is poorly absorbed by chlorophyll a and b.
msmarco_passage_60_56818501	However, owing to the quantum nature of photosynthetic reactions, energy efficiency decreases if light of shorter wavelengths (i.e. higher quantum energy) is used. Additionally, energy losses, energy requirements for plant growth, and the distribution of solar energy wavelengths need to be considered.
msmarco_passage_61_661040766	Carbon dioxide is nessacery for the reaction of photosynthesis to take place, it gets in to the plant as one of the gases in air which then diffuses through the stomata pores (which have to be turgid to let it in and so need water for osmosis).
msmarco_passage_61_661474646	Temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and light intensity are factors that can limit the rate of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis summary Photosynthesis [ photosynthesis: The chemical change that occurs in the leaves of green plants. It uses light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.
msmarco_passage_64_463544015	Carbon Dioxide Concentration. The atmosphere contains 0.03% of carbon dioxide amidst other gases. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air. But, since the amount of CO2 in the air is very less, it acts as a limiting factor for photosynthesis. Experiments have been performed to study the rate of photosynthesis on increasing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
msmarco_passage_64_463544550	It is seen that, when light and temperature are not the limiting factors, increasing CO2 concentration leads to an increase in the rate of photosynthesis. But, beyond a certain limit, CO2 starts accumulating in the plant and this leads to slowing down of the process. So, excessive CO2 inhibits photosynthesis especially when it starts to accumulate.
msmarco_passage_64_463547623	For example, if a leaf is exposed to a certain amount of light intensity with constant temperature but the CO2 available is less, the rate of photosynthesis will not increase with an increase in the light intensity. Therefore, in this case, CO2 is the limiting factor.
msmarco_passage_64_463549283	The amount of light required varies for different plants. Photosynthesis uses maximum up to 1.5 % light in the process and so light is generally not a limiting factor at high intensity. However, the light becomes a limiting factor in low intensity because no matter how much water or CO2 is present, without light photosynthesis cannot occur. At high intensities, the temperature of the plant increases which leads to increased transpiration in the plant.
msmarco_passage_65_225429100	As predicted when the light intensity increases so does the rate of photosynthesis. It was predicted that a level would be reached where increasing the light intensity would have no more effect on the rate of reaction as there would be some other limiting factor which limits the rate of the reaction.
msmarco_passage_65_225429931	As the NaHCO3 concentration the water was increased the rate of photosynthesis also increased. The plant therefore made more oxygen as a waste product. At a NaHCO3 concentration of 0.1M once the light intensity gets above 300 the rate of reaction decreases significantly.
msmarco_passage_65_226105903	Therefore, when this happens, there will be higher amount of energy in the form of ATP to produce a higher amount of glucose and oxygen. Thus, we can conclude that the rate of photosynthesis is higher at the higher light intensity.

[2] It works to avoid oil spills from vessels and facilities by enforcing removal of spilled oil and assigning liability for the cost of cleanup and damage; requires specific operating procedures; defines responsible parties and financial liability; implements processes for measuring damages; specifies damages for which violators are liable; and establishes a fund for damages, cleanup, and removal costs.
msmarco_passage_36_301507809	As a result of the OPA enactment, certain insurance companies refused to issue certifications of financial liability under the Oil Pollution Act to avoid potential responsibility and compensation in the case of a disaster.
msmarco_passage_36_301508151	President Bush also predicted that the enactment of the OPA could lead to larger oil shipping companies being replaced by the smaller shipping companies to avoid liability. In particular, smaller companies with limited resources would lack the finances to remediate oil spill disasters.
msmarco_passage_36_301508981	Ultimately, the threat of unlimited liability under the OPA and other state statutes has led countless oil shipping companies to reduce oil trade to and from the ports of the United States. [13] However, there were positive reactions from the oil industries despite the newly enforced codes and regulations.
msmarco_passage_36_301509436	In 1990, the oil industry united to form the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MRSC), a non-profit corporation whose expenses would be compensated by the oil producers and transporters. The major MRSC responsibility was to develop new response plans for oil spills cleanups and for the OPA-required remediation.
msmarco_passage_36_301509882	Long-term effects of OPA. The Oil Pollution act imposes long term impacts due to the potential for unlimited liability and the statute's that hold insurers to serve as guarantors, which has ultimately resulted in the refusal of insurance companies to issue agreements of financial liability to vessel operators and owners.
msmarco_passage_36_301510338	Lastly, OPA has the ability to directly impact the domestic oil production industry due to the rigorous offshore facility provisions. [14] Financial responsibility: The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for the implementation of the vessel provisions mandated by the Oil Pollutions Act.
msmarco_passage_36_301510770	Disincentives for fleet replacement and modernization: Since the Oil Pollution Act holds the vessel owners fully liable, it has created a disincentive for oil companies to transport crude oil in their vessels and for charterers to transport their oil on the most suitable vessels.
msmarco_passage_37_12435424	On the legal side, there are several laws that are relevant for this case and may be used against the companies responsible for the spill.

According to the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) passed by Congress in 1990, certain facilities that store and use oil are required to prepare plans to respond to a worst-case discharge of oil. OPA also sets specific requirements for the development of such plans. In response, EPA developed regulations in 1994 that implement the facility response planning requirements of OPA.
msmarco_passage_45_442422969	The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amends existing provisions of the Clean Water Act and creates major new authorities addressing oil and hazardous substance spill response. The amended Clean Water Act required the President to revise the NCP to reflect these changes.

In his seminal 1983 book, Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences and his update, Multiple Intelligences: New Horizons, Gardner laid out the theory that paper-and-pencil IQ tests are not the best ways to measure intelligence, which can include spatial, interpersonal, existential, musical and, of course, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.
msmarco_passage_64_129766009	Gardner argues that this kind of skill is not so much a talent as it is an intelligence. "Control of bodily movement is localized in the motor cortex," Gardner says in Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, " and with each hemisphere dominant or controlling bodily movements.". The "evolution" of body movements is an obvious advantage in the human species, suggested Gardner.
msmarco_passage_64_172367505	Howard Gardner's Inspiration. Howard Gardner is a professor of cognition and education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He uses the late English writer Virginia Woolf as an example of a person with a high level of intrapersonal intelligence. He has noted how in her essay, "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf discusses the "cotton wool of existence," or the various mundane events of life.
msmarco_passage_64_185966281	He got both," Gardner, a professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education, explains in his 2006 book, " Multiple Intelligences: New Horizons in Theory and Practice .". "By the time he was ten years old, Menuhin was an international performer.".
msmarco_passage_64_185969967	Gardner's Concerns. Gardner himself has admitted that he is uncomfortable with the labeling of students as having one intelligence or another. He offers three recommendations for educators who would like to use multiple intelligence theory to address the needs of their students:
msmarco_passage_64_415512793	The theory of multiple intelligences was introduced in 1983 by psychologist Howard Gardner in his book Frames of Mind. The essence of Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences (MI) is that each person has eight types of intelligence. According to Howard Gardner, intelligence means “the ability to learn, to solve problems”.
msmarco_passage_64_89670018	How does this theory differ from the traditional definition of intelligence? Gardner's multiple intelligences theory challenged traditional beliefs in the fields of education and cognitive science. According to a traditional definition, intelligence is a uniform cognitive capacity people are born with. This capacity can be easily measured by short-answer tests.
msmarco_passage_65_231495010	My first try was to apply Gardner’s theory in classroom because I am really impressed by what Gardner introduced in the field of education, so I went to the Libyan school in Sheffield City and met with the director of the school and told him that I need to apply Gardner’s theory on students.
msmarco_passage_65_231495431	Gardner has developed his ideas in his book Frames of Mind through Project Zero that acts on performance’s design depends on assessment, education for the purpose of comprehension and the application of multiple intelligences to accomplish self-curriculum and assessment.
msmarco_passage_65_399828602	Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligence. Howard Gardner of Harvard University first came up with the theory of multiple intelligences in 1983. Gardner argues that there are eight types of intelligence, far more than the standard I.Q. test can account for. He goes on to say that these multiple intelligences “challenge an educational system that assumes that everyone can learn the same materials in the same way and that a uniform, universal measure suffices to test student learning.”.
msmarco_passage_65_811764164	Theory of Multiple Intelligences. This theory suggests that traditional psychometric views of intelligence are too limited. Gardner first outlined his theory in his 1983 book Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, where he suggested that all people have different kinds of "intelligences.". Gardner proposed that there are eight intelligences, and has suggested the possible addition of a ninth known as "existentialist intelligence.".
msmarco_passage_65_853423181	Theory of Multiple Intelligences. One of the more recent ideas to emerge is Howard Gardner 's theory of multiple intelligences. Gardner proposed that the traditional idea of intelligence, based on IQ testing, did not fully and accurately depict a person's abilities.
msmarco_passage_65_866953967	Another important concept to emerge in the development of emotional intelligence was the notion of multiple intelligences. This concept was put forth in the mid-1970s by Howard Gardner, introducing the idea that intelligence was more than just a single, general ability.

msmarco_passage_66_136130216	Career and Theories. After spending time working with two very different groups, normal and gifted children, and brain-damaged adults, Gardner began developing a theory designed to synthesize his research and observations. In 1983, he published Frames of Mind which outlined his theory of multiple intelligences.

Following is a step-by-step guide explaining how pulse oximetry screening happens: Between 24 and 48 hours after birth, a health care provider will tell you that it is time for your newborn’s pulse oximetry screening.
msmarco_passage_28_571640345	Pulse Oximetry Screening Results. Pulse oximetry screening determines if your child has certain forms of critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). Most parents receive their newborn’s pulse oximetry screening results as soon as the screening is complete. Two types of results are possible:
msmarco_passage_29_4300194	Typically, these types of heart defects lead to low levels of oxygen in a newborn and may be identified using pulse oximetry screening at least 24 hours after birth. A baby with a critical CCHD needs surgery or other procedures in the first year of life.
msmarco_passage_29_4301362	Timing of CCHD Screening. Screening is done when a baby is at least 24 hours of age, or as late as possible if the baby is to be discharged from the hospital before he or she is 24 hours of age. Pulse Oximetry Screening Results. Pulse oximetry screening is most likely to detect seven of the critical CCHDs.
msmarco_passage_29_4303719	However, some babies are born appearing healthy and without symptoms who may have serious critical congenital heart diseases. These infants will need surgery or intervention within the first year of life. In 2014 Ohio implemented universal newborn screening for critical congenital heart diseases. Legislation and administrative rules, Ohio Revised Code 3701-5010 and Ohio Administrative Code 3701-54-03, require all newborns to be screened for CCHD using pulse oximetry prior to hospital discharge, and for hospitals to report the screening results to the Ohio Department of Health.
msmarco_passage_29_4304448	Screening newborns by pulse oximetry prior to hospital discharge has been shown to be an effective strategy for identifying babies with 7 specific CCHDs. Early diagnosis of CCHDs improves health outcomes for babies and reduces health care costs.

msmarco_passage_00_656327292	The meaning of science has been transformed from a Godly perspective to a Godless agenda.

msmarco_passage_01_154604362	Zarathustra ties the Übermensch to the death of God.

msmarco_passage_03_748624022	For this reason, Young states in his introduction that the focus of his work will largely by-pass the negative aspects of Nietzsche"s critique of religion, and will therefore aim to highlight and expand upon his positive and "constructive" elements instead (Y 6).
msmarco_passage_03_748624843	In light of Nietzsche"s joie de vivre, Young reads him as proposing "a lifeand humanity-affirming religion modelled on that of the Greeks" with ""Dionysian" pantheism" at its very heart (Y 201; BGE 295).Expanding on this idea of Dionysianism, Young is keen to situate it at the very centre of Nietzsche"s philosophy.

msmarco_passage_03_748626524	36 Unlike the "higher religions", whose "God" remains "a ridiculously crude answer" (EH II, 1), this type of religion is "a formula of supreme affirmation of fullness, of superfluity, and affirmation without reservation, even of suffering, even of guilt, even of all that is strange and questionable in existence" (EH IV, 2).

msmarco_passage_42_671386550	What is a Bench Trial? In a criminal proceeding in state court, a defendant may face a jury trial or a bench trial. A jury trial is a trial before a jury of 6 or 12 people who, after hearing the evidence and legal arguments, decide whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charges against him. At a jury trial, the judge must rule on the procedural and evidentiary issues such as who can testify, what witnesses can testify about, and what documents or physical evidence the jury can consider.

This means that the case is heard by a judge rather than a jury. A trial to the court must be held within 60 days after the juvenile's plea of not guilty.
msmarco_passage_43_336694845	What Is Adjudication? Juvenile cases are similar to adult court proceedings. The trial is called an “ adjudicatory hearing ,” where a judge (and in some jurisdictions, a jury) reviews the evidence and determines the facts prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.
msmarco_passage_43_540013266	Trial. Trial is a formal court proceeding where a jury or a judge listens to the facts and evidences presented by parties at dispute and decides on the verdict.
msmarco_passage_43_73627374	Admittedly, since child custody cases in New York do not involve juries, rather they are heard by the assigned judge to a case, usually opening statements are waived. The judge would rather get right to the testimony since opening statements are not evidence. But, sometimes opening statements are done. Opening statements allow child custody lawyer and divorce attorneys to engage the judge in the details of a case.

msmarco_passage_46_300192145	What is divorce arbitration? Divorce arbitration is a divorce trial that is held privately instead of in a public courtroom. You and your spouse choose and hire an arbitrator. The arbitrator, who is similar to a judge, hears arguments from both sides, considers the evidence and renders an enforceable decision — they don’t facilitate negotiations. An arbitrated divorce is faster and less formal than a traditional divorce trial but isn’t available in every state.
msmarco_passage_46_322215814	As each side presents its own evidence and arguments, the other side has an opportunity to question witnesses and challenge evidence through "cross-examination" -- challenging the witness's story, testing their credibility, disputing documents, and otherwise attempt to discredit or discount witnesses and evidence.
msmarco_passage_46_372224732	A divorce trial is very rarely scheduled to take place all at once in a continuous number of days. Typically a divorce trial will begin with motions filed by both sides, motions which the Judge and/or his clerk, will read and rule on. This can take days or weeks.
msmarco_passage_46_372227359	I hope that this helps a bit in dispelling the idea that a "divorce trial" is something that is so dreadful that you should literally give the farm away to avoid it. That isn't always the situation, as a good Judge can be your best friend (most of them can recognize a lying man, or woman, at fifty paces).
msmarco_passage_46_372233096	In short, it's not the scary, "to be avoided at all costs" matter that we women tend to think it is. A divorce trial is not to air all the dirty linen. It's not a "She did, he did" drama, like a daytime soap. It is, to put it simply, the standard legal way that contracts are examined, broken, changed, or ended, when the two parties to that contract can't come to a decision.
msmarco_passage_46_867438444	A trial is the formal presentation of a case to a trier of fact, which is usually a jury. On occasion, attorneys will agree to a bench trial, which means that the presiding judge will make the ultimate decision regarding liability. However, bench trials are rare in cases with any significant monetary value.
msmarco_passage_47_35489261	In a bench trial, on the other hand, the parties are giving the jury’s power to decide the facts to the judge. The judge then effectively serves as both the judge and the jury, deciding what the facts are and what the law is. There are two types of trial, a jury trial and a bench trial (also known as a court trial).
msmarco_passage_49_123208220	Why One Might Choose a Bench Trial. A case decided by a judge without the assistance of a jury is often referred to as a “bench trial.”. In bench trials, the judge takes on two roles: that of the referee who rules on the admissibility of evidence and decides questions of law, and that of the finder of fact who ultimately determines how much weight to give the testimony of different witnesses and the credibility of the evidence.
msmarco_passage_49_123208798	Some cases must be handled by a judge in a bench trial. These include cases that present only questions of law or equity (such as divorces, child custody cases, foreclosures, actions for permanent injunctions, and others).

msmarco_passage_51_344385960	Child Support and Child Custody in Out-of-State Divorces. When a divorce involves child support and child custody, an out-of-state divorce may not have jurisdiction over the child issues. Child support and child custody may have to be determined by the family court in the state where the children live. The out-of-state divorce may still be valid but the out-of-state court may not be able to make child custody or visitation decisions.
msmarco_passage_51_520734464	In many states, there are no juries in divorce trials. When a couple divorces, there are usually a host of decisions that need to be made.

msmarco_passage_52_156817616	What Is a Final Judgment of Divorce? The Final Judgement of Divorce is the written court order that formally dissolves the marriage. It will also contain the terms of the judge's ruling after a trial on all the aspects of the divorce, such as child custody, child support, alimony, and division of property. (If the couple settled some or all of these issues, their settlement terms are included in the judgment after trial.)
msmarco_passage_52_157009328	Along the road to trial, you’ve probably attended at least a hearing or two. A hearing is different from a trial because the judge makes decisions about the disputed issues, but the decisions are only temporary and they only last until the judge issues a final order. Apart from settlement, a divorce trial is the only way that a court can make a final decision about your case.
msmarco_passage_52_157010218	When the trial starts, you’ll almost always find that your case is going to be tried in front of a judge without a jury (“bench trial”).

msmarco_passage_03_266477381	The kanima is a type of human-animal hybrid that is reptilian in nature. It is considered a mutation of the werewolf gene, though how exactly they came to be remains a mystery.
msmarco_passage_03_266477686	Biography. In a legend about the kanima found in the Bestiary belonging to the Argent family of hunters, the being is known as a weapon of vengeance; the legend in question detailed a South American priest who took control of a kanima, and used it to rid his village of murderers. The more the priest and master influenced the kanima, the symbiotic bond between them grew until the kanima began killing whomever its master wanted to die regardless of whether or not it had taken a life.
msmarco_passage_03_266478313	The kanima is essentially a werewolf whose transformation has somehow "gone wrong;" it is believed that this is as a result of the personal demons in the kanima's past, which for some reason caused the human to mutate and take on a more reptilian form.
msmarco_passage_03_266478684	Unlike a werewolf, who is predisposed to seek out a pack (as it both makes them more powerful individually and provides them with a support system of fellow werewolves who are closer to them than family), the kanima is an inherently subservient being who seeks out a master to control its actions.
msmarco_passage_03_266479098	Jackson Whittemore is the only known person in the series to be a true kanima, although, judging by photos of Eichen House patients who had trephination performed on them by Gabriel Valack, there has been at least one other kanima in Beacon Hills in recent history.

The Alpha form also includes wings on the kanima's back.
msmarco_passage_03_266480358	Once this connection is made with its master, the kanima will usually do whatever its told. If the bond is strong enough between the kanima and its master then the master will only need to consciously will their intentions, and the kanima will carry it out.
msmarco_passage_03_266480744	Because Matt had broken the metaphysical rules of the kanima, he began to turn into a kanima as punishment, though he was killed before the transformation was complete. Kanimas also appear to take on some personality traits of their master.

msmarco_passage_03_266483487	Super Strength: Kanimas possess a tremendous amount of strength. This was demonstrated in almost every encounter with it, as Jackson was shown to be capable of tearing through bones, ripping off car doors, and breaking through corrugated steel walls. The kanima is superior in strength to most, if not all, werewolves.
msmarco_passage_03_266484400	Super Agility/Reflexes Kanimas possess supernaturally enhanced agility and reflexes. The kanima has been known to climb vertical surfaces with ease, such as walls or buildings, and can perform a multitude of gymnastic and acrobatic feats to aid in their combat skills.

msmarco_passage_03_266485238	The kanima typically fully transforms due to the fact that they're more powerful in that form; when that happens, its full body becomes snake-like with smooth, shiny green scales. When in their full Kanima form, the kanima's claws are more like talons that secrete venom.
msmarco_passage_03_266485642	Paralytic Venom: The kanima's claws and the tip of their tail contains an unknown form of venom that can paralyze its victims in seconds or minutes, depending on the amount of exposure and the healing ability of the victim. Skin contact is required for the venom to take effect.
msmarco_passage_03_266486053	Seeing as the kanima is like a snake, it should be noted that the kanima in its shifted form cannot be paralyzed by its own venom; however, in human form, it can be paralyzed, which led to the difficulty in learning the kanima's true identity.
msmarco_passage_03_266486415	This weakness also extends to the kanima's master, regardless of whether or not they're truly supernatural on their own. However, this weakness does not extend to part-kanima Chimeras due to not being truly supernatural creatures. The Master: The Kanima suffers from the same weaknesses as its master.

This is believed to be the origin of his emotional and identity issues, which is what ultimately caused his body to reject the Alpha bite and transform into a kanima.
msmarco_passage_03_266488860	However, after Matt began to transform into a kanima himself after breaking the rules of the reptilian creature, he was killed by Gerard Argent, who then immediately took control of Jackson to use his kanima nature for his own ends.
msmarco_passage_03_266489211	Its later revealed that Jackson remains part kanima and still has some of his old abilities; his claws still produce kanima venom, he can still make his kanima eyes visible with a certain amount of concentration and effort, and he still could extend and retract his prehensile tail, which he used for a number of feats.
msmarco_passage_03_266522449	After Deaton's examination, he went to the McCall House, where he informed Scott and Kira that not only did Belasko have the Shapeshifting capabilities of a Werewolf with the talons of a Garuda, Tracy had the claws and fangs of a Werewolf in addition to the tail, scales, and venom of a Kanima.

msmarco_passage_03_267540068	Peter Hale suggests that Jackson is the Beta form of the creature and he is transforming into the next level of development which apparently means he grows wings. Gerard once again uses Jackson to fight the wolves. Once the old man begins to die and Lydia shows up Jackson begins to revert to his human form.
msmarco_passage_03_267541408	The Two Kanima. There are several visible differences in the appearance of the kanima creature seen early in the season and those in later episodes. The scales of the face are shaped and arrayed differently, early kanima had squared off and pointy scales while the later version was more rounded.
msmarco_passage_03_267541845	The overall shape of the face is different, with early kanima displaying a weak chin and later kanima with an oversized square-jawed dimpled chin.

msmarco_passage_23_806696199	Body fat percentage (BFP) is simply the amount of fat, or the fat mass, of your body divided by your overall total body weight (or mass). This does not necessarily mean that once the percentage of body fat has been deducted from the equation, that everything else that is left is muscle mass. After the fat percentage of the body has been calculated everything left over is known as ‘ lean body mass ’ or lean mass.
msmarco_passage_24_137886434	0.10 x 140 = 14 lbs. of body fat. Add your total bone mass weight and total body fat weight together and subtract the sum from your starting total weight (in pounds). This will calculate your total muscle mass. 21 lbs. of total bone mass + 14 lbs. of body fat = 35 lbs.
msmarco_passage_24_157890175	0.10 x 140 = 14 lbs. of body fat. Add your total bone mass weight and total body fat weight together and subtract the sum from your starting total weight (in pounds). This will calculate your total muscle mass. 21 lbs. of total bone mass + 14 lbs. of body fat = 35 lbs.
msmarco_passage_24_293474499	Step 6. Subtract your lean body mass from your total weight to derive your body fat mass. Continuing with the example, subtracting 90.4 from 120 calculates 29.6 pounds of body fat.
msmarco_passage_24_293475974	Step 3. Subtract your lean body mass from your total body weight to calculate your body fat mass. Continuing with the example, 180 minus 141.1 calculates your body fat mass of 31.9 pounds.
msmarco_passage_25_498024196	4. Fat. Here are some less common (but important) body composition terms: Dry Lean Mass (DLM): Your Dry Lean Mass is the combination of the weight attributed to the protein and the bone mineral in your body. Lean Body Mass (LBM): Your Lean Body Mass is the combination of your DLM and body water.
msmarco_passage_25_498045233	Building Lean Body Mass. It’s helpful to understand what Lean Body Mass is so you can understand how you can go about developing it. Lean Body Mass is your total weight minus your fat. This includes all the weight due to your muscles, organs, and total body water.
msmarco_passage_25_498081178	Lean Body Mass is different from skeletal muscle in that Lean Body Mass includes the weight attributed to muscle, body water, bone, and everything else that isn’t fat. To illustrate, take a look at the body composition breakdown of this 162-pound male:
msmarco_passage_25_498243777	Building Lean Body Mass. It’s helpful to understand what Lean Body Mass is so you can understand how you can go about developing it. Lean Body Mass is your total weight minus your fat. This includes all the weight due to your muscles, organs, and total body water.
msmarco_passage_25_498270562	Put simply, body fat is the amount of fat you have in your body, excluding your fat-free mass (or lean body mass). Your fat-free mass is made up of your bones, organs, muscles, and body water. Your body fat percentage (also known as percent body fat) reflects how much of your weight is made up of body fat.
msmarco_passage_25_498281634	Bones. Body Water. Muscle Mass. Unlike lean muscle, Lean Body Mass correctly uses the word “lean” as it describes the entire weight of your body minus fat. This is why it is also known as “Fat-Free Mass.”.
msmarco_passage_25_498282024	Because your Lean Body Mass comprises so many parts, any change in the weight of these areas can be recorded as changes in LBM. Keep in mind, the weight of your organs will not change much. Bone density will decrease over time, but it won’t significantly affect the weight of your LBM.
msmarco_passage_25_498284382	To illustrate this point, here’s a body composition analysis of a 174.1-pound male. Body Composition Analysis taken using the InBody. 98.1 (Total Body Water) + 35.5 (Dry Lean Mass) = 133.6 Lean Body Mass. Water made up more than 55% of total body weight, which is normal for healthy adult males.
msmarco_passage_25_498288524	Because of the nature of Lean Body Mass, it is very hard to say how much of the gain is due to water and how much is due to muscle (which is largely water to begin with). A gain of 5 pounds of LBM is not 5 pounds of pure muscle,
msmarco_passage_25_498289798	Lean Body Mass vs. Muscle Mass. Lean Body Mass (also sometimes known as simply “lean mass,” likely the source of the word “lean muscle”) is the total weight of your body minus all the weight due to your fat mass.
msmarco_passage_25_498354963	What our body is made of. Body composition is the term used to describe the components that make up your body: fat and fat-free mass. Fat-free mass is made up of everything that isn’t fat, such as protein (lean muscle, organs), water, and minerals (i.e., bones and iron in the blood). To change your body composition, you can’t simply focus on the larger goal of weight loss.
msmarco_passage_25_498432234	LBM is the weight of everything in the body that is not body fat. This includes muscle, water, bones, organs – everything that is not Body Fat. Most of the time, increases in LBM reflect increases in muscle (which you can also see as an increase in DLM), and is considered a positive improvement in body composition.
msmarco_passage_25_856491012	Subsequently, the body fat mass was derived from the equations of Durnin and Womersley [ 20 ]. LBM was calculated as the difference between body mass and body fat mass. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was measured using the body composition analyzer BIA-101 (RJL system, Detroit) in order to estimate total body water.
msmarco_passage_26_182794069	Lean Body Mass Versus Fat Body Mass. The body is made up of a variety of elements, including blood, bones, muscles, skin, and more. But when evaluating the health of your body, a common biomarker is determining how much of your body is comprised of lean body mass and fat body mass. In simple terms, lean body mass (LBM)—comprised of bones, ligaments, tendons, internal organs, and muscles (muscle mass)—is the difference between your total body weight and your body-fat weight.
msmarco_passage_26_182794717	So, fat body mass is the difference between your total body weight and your lean-body weight. LBM usually averages between 60 to 90 percent of total body weight for the average person, and men generally have a higher percentage of LBM than women do. The BMI (body mass index discussed above) takes into account how much lean and fat body weight an average, healthy person would have based on their height, then gives an estimate of your body’s fat and lean composition based on their weight.
msmarco_passage_26_352847528	There are many folks out there, including experts, who believe there to be 11 components of fitness. The 11th one being ‘body composition’, which is a breakdown of your body weight into fat and lean body mass or LBM for short…. LBM takes into account all your muscles, bones, organ fluids etc.
msmarco_passage_27_431753051	Body composition is the percentage of a body’s weight that is fat tissue. Body composition is the body’s amount of fat relative to fat-free mass .
msmarco_passage_29_595843133	What is Partial Molar Volume. Partial molar volume is a thermodynamic property of substances that is defined as the contribution of components in a mixture for the overall volume of the mixture.

msmarco_passage_39_707564037	For LBM maintenance purposes an endurance athlete who weighs 180 pounds with 10% body fat should eat 1 gram of protein per pound of lean body mass weight per day at 162 grams of protein (648 calories), 3.5 grams of carbohydrates per pound of body weight per day at 630 grams of carbohydrates (2,520 calories), and 0.3 grams of fat per pound of body weight per day at 54 grams of fat (486 calories).
msmarco_passage_39_711201217	Now that you know your estimated body fat percentage, let’s take that number and figure out your LBM (Lean Body Mass) so we can plug it into the Katch Mcardle formula (which helps to calculate your BMR; basal metabolic rate). Now, let’s say your 140lb and have a body fat of 28%. To figure out your lean body mass, (LBM), calculate.
msmarco_passage_40_251191524	Body composition. Body composition refers to the relative percentage of body weight that is made up of body fat and fat-free mass (anything other than fat like muscles, organs, blood, bones and water).
msmarco_passage_40_253767765	BuiltLean.com Ideal Body Weight Formula. It turns out there’s a MUCH better way to calculate your ideal weight that takes into account your body fat percentage. Here it is: Lean Body Mass/(1 – Desired Body Fat Percentage) where Lean Body Mass (LBM)= Your Body Weight – (Your Body Weight x Your Current Body Fat Percentage)
msmarco_passage_40_253768267	Just to be clear, your LBM is your “fat free” mass, in other words, everything in your body that’s not fat: your bones, blood, muscle, and organs. Let me give you an example of this ideal body weight formula in action so you can see why it’s so useful. Let’s take Jake who is 200 pounds and has 22% body fat.
msmarco_passage_40_253768741	Hey Josh, the 15% is the desired body fat percentage that you want. So at 184lb, you will have 15% body fat assuming your LBM is 156lb. The idea is that as long as you know (1) your current LBM and (2) your desired body fat percentage, then you will be able to figure out your “ideal” weight that you are targeting.
msmarco_passage_40_253775274	The LBM formula is definitely not appropriate for population studies, but I find it EXTREMELY valuable with individual clients and use it all the time. Separating LBM from fat and playing with different desired body fat percentages and how that relates to body weight is very, very useful.
msmarco_passage_40_253819046	To get down to 20% body fat keeping the same LBM (assumes no muscle loss), you need to lose 10lb of fat, so your new body weight will be 123lb. The formula is current LBM/(1-desired body fat percentage), so it’s 98/(1-.20) = 122.5. Done!
msmarco_passage_40_253900849	Definition: What is Lean Body Mass (aka LBM)? Simply put, lean body mass is comprised of everything in your body besides body fat. 1 Your lean body mass includes: …and anything else in our bodies that has mass and is not fat.

msmarco_passage_40_515394676	Metric: Total Body Fat = Weight in Kg * (body fat % / 100) English: Total Body Fat = Weight in lb * (body fat % / 100)
msmarco_passage_41_267966562	A body composition scale breaks down that total body weight into the various elements that make it up. Your body is composed of three main components: fat, lean body mass (muscle, bone, and organs), and water.
msmarco_passage_42_691449377	Your LBM is simply your body fat subtracted from your total body weight. LBM includes organs, bones, muscle, and everything else in your body besides body fat. Typically, changes in LBM are primarily from increases or decreases in muscle mass.
msmarco_passage_42_691449767	Usually, this is listed as Bone Mineral Content (BMC) on a DEXA report. It’s important to note that when viewing a DEXA report, LBM is calculated by adding the “Lean Tissue” and “BMC” measurements together. A hydrostatic test will give you LBM and body fat only.
msmarco_passage_46_406218554	What is Body Fat Percentage (BFP)? Your body fat percentage (BFP or BF%) is the percentage of your body fat in relation to your overall weight. If you weigh 200lbs and your body fat percentage is 30%, this means that your body fat weight (BFW) is 60lbs. The other 140lbs is your lean body mass (LBM). Do The Math.
msmarco_passage_46_406219022	Formula: Total Weight X BFP = Fat Weight. Example: 200lbs X .30 = 60lbs. Lean body mass -- also known as fat-free mass (FFM) -- is everything else that your body is composed of (muscle, water, connective tissues, blood, skin, organs and so on). Fat weight and lean body mass make up your body composition. So, body composition is defined as the makeup of the body in terms of the relative percentage of fat-free mass and body fat.
msmarco_passage_47_534362874	What is BMI? Body Mass Index (BMI) is an index that attempt to quantify the amount of muscle, fat, and bone mass in an individual, and categorize them as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, based on the index value. The simplicity of the body mass index calculation is one of its advantages: to calculate it one only needs to know his or her weight and height.
msmarco_passage_47_619580096	Men have higher BMRs than women, regardless of age. This is because women and men have different body compositions, and men naturally have more muscle mass and less fat. 7. Body Composition. Your body’s composition of lean muscle and fat (referred to as Lean Body Mass) is a key indicator of its ability to maintain a high BMR in the long-term. Someone with higher LBM will naturally burn more calories and enjoy a higher BMR than someone at the same weight with a higher percentage of fat.
msmarco_passage_48_513525248	Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) or reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (RetHe) is a measure of the amount of Hb in the reticulocytes, red blood cells that are just 1 or 2 days old. It is a relatively new measurement of iron status that provides an indirect measure of iron available for erythropoiesis.
msmarco_passage_50_459571864	Bones. Body Water. Muscle Mass. Unlike lean muscle, Lean Body Mass correctly uses the word “lean” as it describes the entire weight of your body minus fat. This is why it is also known as “Fat-Free Mass.”.
msmarco_passage_50_459572255	Because your Lean Body Mass comprises so many parts, any change in the weight of these areas can be recorded as changes in LBM. Keep in mind, the weight of your organs will not change much. Bone density will decrease over time, but it won’t significantly affect the weight of your LBM.
msmarco_passage_50_459574618	To illustrate this point, here’s a body composition analysis of a 174.1-pound male. Body Composition Analysis taken using the InBody. 98.1 (Total Body Water) + 35.5 (Dry Lean Mass) = 133.6 Lean Body Mass. Water made up more than 55% of total body weight, which is normal for healthy adult males.
msmarco_passage_50_459578770	Because of the nature of Lean Body Mass, it is very hard to say how much of the gain is due to water and how much is due to muscle (which is largely water to begin with). A gain of 5 pounds of LBM is not 5 pounds of pure muscle,
msmarco_passage_50_459580047	Lean Body Mass vs. Muscle Mass. Lean Body Mass (also sometimes known as simply “lean mass,” likely the source of the word “lean muscle”) is the total weight of your body minus all the weight due to your fat mass.
msmarco_passage_50_459586659	Fitness for Long-Term Health. Muscle building isn’t something that only bodybuilders and athletes should worry about; for long-term health, everyone can benefit from building their LBM. For this reason, it is important to monitor the changes in your Lean Body Mass by having your body composition measured. Body composition analysis can divide your weight into its various components – Fat Mass, Lean Body Mass, etc. – which will give you a much clearer picture of your overall fitness and health.
msmarco_passage_51_328534969	Step 1 – Calculate lean body mass (LBM) A simple estimate of 25% of total body weight can be used to determine LBM. For example, an individual weighing 165 lbs would yield 41 lbs of fat mass and 124 lbs of lean mass (165 x .25 = 41 lbs). Alternatively, several online calculators are available that provide an estimate.
msmarco_passage_51_764909851	Body fat percentage is the percentage of your total body mass that is made of fat. So if a 200 pound guy has 20 lbs. of fat on his body, he has 10% body fat (20/200=10%). The remaining 180 lbs., or 90% of his total body mass (i.e. muscle, bone, organs, water, etc.), is considered his lean body mass (LBM).
msmarco_passage_51_764927566	Step #3: Estimate Your Lean Body Mass (LBM) You need a rough estimate of your lean body mass in order to set your protein intake correctly. The calculation for lean body mass (LBM) is simple. It’s your total bodyweight (BW) minus the weight of your body fat (BF).
msmarco_passage_53_204856232	Fat Free Mass (FFM) Where Body Fat Mass is the total mass of the fat in the body, Fat Free Mass is everything else: including bones, muscle and water. A Fat-Free Mass of around 10-12% for men and 20-32% for women is ideal. You can read more about these readings in this white paper.

msmarco_passage_59_56184136	By Staff Writer Last Updated Apr 2, 2020 10:52:30 PM ET. Body composition is a special term used in physical fitness that measures the percentage of fat, muscle, water and bone found in the human body. Measuring body composition is a specialized way to determine one's true physical fitness. Body composition goes beyond a number on a scale and looks inside a person to see what percentage of their body is fat, muscle, bone and water.
msmarco_passage_60_30084160	Cellular. The cellular level of body composition consists of body cells (body cell mass) and their surrounding extracellular water, plus the skeleton and connective tissue. Although there is some lipid in the form of cell membranes, this compartment is largely fat-free and these components are sometimes termed the fat-free mass (FFM) or in older terminology the lean body mass (LBM).
msmarco_passage_60_30350358	Subjects on the supplement on average gained 2.2-kg body mass, had no significant change in percent body fat, and gained 1.6 kg of lean body mass (LBM). In contrast, subjects on the placebo on average gained 1.25-kg body mass, had an increase in body fat of 1.1%, and increased their LBM 0.04 kg.
msmarco_passage_60_30350787	Body composition was estimated by measuring thigh, abdomen, and chest skin folds and thigh, bicep, and calf circumference. After 14 days, subjects receiving Cr on average lost 2.7% of their body fat and had an increase of LBM of 1.8 kg, while no changes were observed in the control group.

At the highest level of the luxury SUV world is the Range Rover, a full-size Land Rover SUV with opulent features and an almost 6-figure price tag.
msmarco_passage_38_494073980	Features in each Range Rover include a voice-activated navigation system, automatic xenon headlights, dual power front seats, 19-inch alloy wheels, a power liftgate, leather upholstery and park assist. But when it comes to their overall feature sets, the Range Rover just slightly edges out the Sport.
msmarco_passage_38_494074410	Technology. Neither the Range Rover nor the Range Rover Sport holds the upper hand in terms of technology, though the full-size Range Rover certainly includes more items as standard.
msmarco_passage_38_494074721	On the options list, there are features like blind spot monitoring, an automated parallel park system, rear cross-traffic alert, a surround-view camera system and adaptive cruise control. Perhaps the Range Rover’s biggest benefit over the Sport is its sound system.
msmarco_passage_38_494075120	Safety. As with their technology and feature sets, safety is largely the same between the Range Rover and the Range Rover Sport. Both models offer all the basics, including front-side airbags, curtain-side airbags, rear-side airbags, park assist, a backup camera, anti-lock brakes and traction control with stability control.
msmarco_passage_38_494076038	Conclusions. The 2014 Range Rover Sport and the 2014 Range Rover are very similar SUVs, but they do have a few major differences. For many shoppers, price alone will eliminate the Range Rover from contention, as its $84,000 starting MSRP places it at the very highest end of the luxury SUV realm, while the Sport’s $63,500 MSRP is more reasonable.
msmarco_passage_38_494076531	Other shoppers will choose the Sport for its smaller size, or its third-row seat — a feature the full-size model still doesn’t even offer. But for the few drivers who have to have the last word in the luxury SUV segment, nothing, not even the highly capable Range Rover Sport, compares to the full-size Range Rover.
msmarco_passage_38_494077936	During the 2006 model year, Land Rover added the Range Rover Sport — which, because of its similarities to the Range Rover, can be difficult to distinguish from Land Rover’s original SUV. We’ve created the following list of differences between the 2014 Range Rover and 2014 Range Rover Sport to help you better identify and understand the two models individually.
msmarco_passage_38_494078439	Exterior. Although the Range Rover and the Range Rover Sport might seem similar at first glance, there are definite differences between the two. Parked side-by-side, there’s almost no confusing them, as the full-size Range Rover is significantly larger than its Sport stablemate.
msmarco_passage_38_494079263	But the easiest way to distinguish the two SUVs is by their sides: The Range Rover Sport has a small grille mounted behind its front wheels, while the full-size Range Rover does not.
msmarco_passage_38_494079562	The primary difference between the two today is that the 2014 Sport retains a sportier feel, with a higher center console and more interior curves, while the full-size Range Rover goes for a more dignified appearance, with a taller center control stack that gives the dashboard a wider look and feel.
msmarco_passage_38_494079979	The full-size Range Rover also retains its pop-up circular gear selector knob, while the Sport uses a more traditional gear lever. In back, there’s an even bigger difference between the Range Rover and the Sport: the number of seats. While the all-new 2014 Range Rover Sport now offers available 3-row seating, the Range Rover still only offers two rows.
msmarco_passage_38_494080479	Mechanicals. When it comes to mechanicals, the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport have always been similar — and that remains true for 2014. Earlier models rode on separate platforms: The Range Rover Sport shared its underpinnings with the Land Rover LR3, while the Range Rover had its own platform. But that’s no longer true for 2014, as the full-size Range Rover and the newly redesigned Sport now use the same chassis.
msmarco_passage_38_494081062	Under the skin, the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport share virtually everything. The engines are the same: Both models use a 340-horsepower supercharged V6 in base versions, while Supercharged models offer a 510-hp supercharged V8.
msmarco_passage_38_494081789	Features. As you might expect, the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport both have similar equipment — and neither one skimps on the lavish luxuries. With that said, the Range Rover Sport’s base price of around $63,500 is far less than the Range Rover’s $84,000 starting MSRP, and in some cases, the reasons for that are obvious.
msmarco_passage_38_498013421	What’s the difference between a Range Rover Sport and a Range Rover? The Sport is a midsize luxury SUV with the option of three seating rows. The Range Rover is a full-size luxury SUV with seating for five or, if the client wanted, a 4-seater arrangement.

msmarco_passage_40_674986589	Overview. Slightly smaller and more agile than the regular Range Rover, the Range Rover Sport offers similar luxury and cachet with a less painful price tag.

msmarco_passage_44_757711640	Land Rover Range Rover Sport vs. Land Rover Range Rover Velar. While the Range Rover Sport is a midsize SUV with seating for up to seven, the Land Rover Range Rover Velar is a two-row that splits the difference between the compact and midsize segments.

msmarco_passage_52_22500753	In the Land Rover Discovery Sport's favor is the fact that its sound system comes with more speakers; ten compared to the Range Rover Evoque's six.
msmarco_passage_52_22501514	The new Land Rover Discovery Sport and Land Rover Range Rover Sport are both luxurious vehicles that are excellent for going off the beaten path. The biggest difference between these two SUVs is that the Discovery Sport is considered a crossover, while the Range Rover Sport is a midsize SUV.

msmarco_passage_52_22513654	Interior. The interiors both features a new dual touchscreen center console interface. The Range Rover's is lined in the silver trim, whereas the Velar's piano black finishing goes to the edges of what is being called a "floating console" design.

msmarco_passage_52_22514616	Performance. While both are powerful SUVs the Range Rover Sport is a heavier, more powerful and more capable off-road model.

msmarco_passage_52_22654803	As its core, the difference between Land Rover and Range Rover is quite simple; Land Rover is the make and Range Rover is a model. Therefore, all Range Rovers are Land Rovers, but not all Land Rovers are Range Rovers. In addition to being a model name, Range Rover is a sub-brand within Land Rover. Range Rover models are designed to be more luxurious while the Land Rover lineup is aimed at being more adventurous.
msmarco_passage_52_22655362	The Origins of Range Rover. As one of the most iconic British car manufacturers in history, Land Rover is known worldwide for its incredible four-wheel-drive vehicles. Tracing its roots back to 1948 with the introduction of the Series I Land Rover, the brand quickly grew in popularity, especially in the off-road market.
msmarco_passage_52_22656142	Although successful abroad, it wasn't until 1987 that the Range Rover was officially sold in America, a model which is now one of the most popular luxury SUVs on the market. Today those early principles still hold true, making the Range Rover one of the best SUVs you can buy.
msmarco_passage_52_22656546	Since the introduction of the Range Rover, the brand has continually produced Land Rover models alongside it, giving buyers more options to choose from than ever before.

Due to their service and range of models, Land Rover is considered as one of the top SUV brands.
msmarco_passage_54_416505933	Both SUVs offer a wide variety of engines, from high-performing V-8s to fuel-sipping turbo-fours. If you're looking to save fuel, the Sport offers a plug-in hybrid powertrain that delivers 42 MPGe ( see our explanation of MPGe here ). The Sport also boasts a fuel-efficient diesel engine that nets 24 mpg combined.
msmarco_passage_54_416506388	That's comparable to the four-cylinder gas engine offered on the Velar, which tops out at 23 mpg. The Range Rover Sport delivers a bit more power than the Velar. The Sport gets anywhere from 254 hp to 575 hp, depending on the engine chosen, compared to the Velar's 247 to 550 hp. No matter which version of the Sport or Velar you get, it won't be a slouch.
msmarco_passage_54_416508357	See all 54 photos. If you're looking for serious off-road capability, the Sport should be your pick. It offers a high-/low-range transfer case for precise control in off-road situations. The Velar, on the other hand, is less tailored to Moab-style rock-crawling, but will be sufficiently capable of getting you to your snow chalet.
msmarco_passage_54_416508841	Range Rover intended the Velar to be more off-road capable than most SUVs, but it still can't compete with the Sport as it doesn't have the Sport's low-range transfer case. The Range Rover Sport boasts an approach angle of 29.1 degrees and departure angle of 28.5 degrees. Compare that to the Velar's 21.2 degrees and 20.6 degrees.
msmarco_passage_54_416509313	Both models are available with many off-road features. These include All Terrain Progress Control, a low-speed cruise control for driving on slippery surfaces; and Terrain Response 2, which automatically selects the right driving mode for the traction conditions.
msmarco_passage_54_416510142	Which Is More Expensive? You can get a 2020 Range Rover Velar for as low as $57,325 if you opt for the four-cylinder engine. The 2020 Range Rover Sport, however, starts at $69,945, with the base model carrying the 355-hp six-cylinder. The price variation is even bigger if you compare the top trims of both models.
msmarco_passage_54_416510609	Which Is the Best? See all 54 photos. When it comes to buying the Range Rover Velar vs. Sport, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Buyers looking for top off-road performance will want to veer toward the Range Rover Sport.
msmarco_passage_54_416510985	The Sport has bigger exterior dimensions. The Velar has more cargo space. The Sport is more powerful, and it offers PHEV and diesel versions. The Sport is more capable off-road. The Velar is less expensive.
msmarco_passage_54_416511356	While the Evoque is noticeably the smallest model, it can be harder to tell the other variants apart, especially the similarly-sized and -priced Sport and Velar.
msmarco_passage_54_416511632	Is the Range Rover Velar larger than the Sport? The Velar is actually smaller, but not by much. It's about 3 inches shorter in length and an inch and a half less wide. But the biggest difference is its low roofline; it's about 5.5 inches closer to the ground than the Sport.
msmarco_passage_54_416512054	The Range Rover Sport is a midsize SUV that competes with the likes of the Porsche Cayenne and BMW X6. The Velar slots just below the Sport in Range Rover's lineup. Although the overall size difference between the two models might not be immediately apparent, the low roof and windswept body distinguish the Velar from its boxy sibling.
msmarco_passage_54_416512531	Whereas the Velar offers seating for five, the Range Rover Sport has room for up to seven people, depending on the trim. Be warned: the third-row seats are a tight squeeze, though, as it is a 5+2 configuration. Overall, the Velar has more cargo room.
msmarco_passage_54_416512922	Behind the second row, the Range Rover Sport provides 27.5 cubic feet of cargo space (24.8 for the PHEV), compared to 34.4 cubic feet for the Velar. The Sport's cargo volume maxes out at 59.5 cubic feet (56.8 for the PHEV) behind the first row, but it's a whopping 70.1 cubic feet in the Velar.
msmarco_passage_55_256554245	Find Car. Buy New. Find Used. The Range Rover Sport has been substantially revised for the 2010 model year with fresh styling, all-new engines, a redesigned interior, chassis refinements, and new technologies, including a surround camera system designed to aid towing and driving off road. The Range Rover Sport was added to the Land Rover product portfolio only a few years ago as a bridge between the top-of-the-line Range Rover and the Land Rover LR3 (previously called Discovery and for 2010 called the LR4).
msmarco_passage_55_256558723	The 2010 Range Rover Sport and Land Rover LR4 are close cousins, sharing platforms, drive systems, suspension, and powertrain. The Range Rover Sport boasts more standard equipment, more upscale styling, and generally a more luxurious approach to the same mission: go anywhere, do anything, in any weather.

msmarco_passage_04_652471247	The severity of the deficiency is usually described as early or mild. An increased level of methylmalonic acid may also indicate kidney disease. Other tests are needed to confirm kidney disease, but the elevated level of methylmalonic acid in the blood may be due to the decreased excretion of methylmalonic acid in the urine.
msmarco_passage_04_652471715	If the test is done on infants, and the level of methylmalonic acid is extremely high, the cause is most likely methylmalonic acidemia. The severity of the disease can range from mild to life threatening.
msmarco_passage_04_652472437	The symptoms that prompt a doctor to order an MMA blood test usually include numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. The MMA blood test is also used to screen newborn babies for a rare metabolic disorder called methylmalonic acidemia. This disorder is characterized by the inability to process methylmalonyl CoA.
msmarco_passage_04_652472890	What Does the Test Measure? The MMA blood test measures the level of methylmalonic acid in the blood. In a healthy individual, methylmalonic acid is normally produced in low quantities as a byproduct of amino acid metabolism. Any increase in the concentration of methylmalonic acid in the blood usually indicates a problem with vitamin B12.
msmarco_passage_04_652473381	Vitamin B12 is required to convert methylmalonic CoA to succinyl CoA in the normal metabolic process. If there is not enough vitamin B12 to convert methylmalonic CoA to succinyl CoA, then the amount of methylmalonic CoA increases.
msmarco_passage_04_652474540	Test Results for MMA. The results of the MMA blood test show how much methylmalonic acid is in the blood. If the level of methylmalonic acid in the blood is elevated, the homocysteine level is high, and the vitamin B12 level is low, then the cause is vitamin B12 deficiency.

msmarco_passage_06_762877157	Measurement of methylmalonic acid through the methylmalonic acid test can provide your doctor with information about an existing vitamin deficiency, especially if the B-12 deficiency is mild or just beginning. The methylmalonic acid test is more sensitive than the vitamin B-12 test. As a result, it’s better able to identify vitamin B-12 deficiencies at the lower end of the normal range.
msmarco_passage_06_762877693	The methylmalonic acid test is often used along with the vitamin B-12 test or to clarify ambiguous vitamin B-12 test results. It’s also often performed along with the homocysteine test. Homocysteine is an important molecule found in very small amounts in the body.
msmarco_passage_06_762878514	When is the test ordered? The methylmalonic acid test isn’t typically ordered as part of a routine physical exam. Your doctor may order the test if the result of your vitamin B-12 test is abnormal. In addition, the test may be ordered if you have symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency.
msmarco_passage_06_762879377	The methylmalonic acid test may also be ordered if the results of other blood tests are abnormal. For instance, abnormal results from a homocysteine test may prompt your doctor to order the methylmalonic acid test. The methylmalonic acid test is also frequently ordered for infants when the doctor suspects the presence of methylmalonic acidemia.
msmarco_passage_06_762879865	The methylmalonic acid test is performed on blood plasma or blood serum taken from a standard blood draw. Typically, a doctor or nurse will take a blood sample from your arm in a clinical setting. The blood will be collected in a tube and sent to a lab for analysis. Once the lab reports the results, your doctor will be able to provide you with more information about the results and what they mean.
msmarco_passage_06_762881318	The results of the methylmalonic acid test may vary depending on the laboratory that performs the test. In general, normal levels of methylmalonic acid are between 0.00 and 0.40 umol/mL (micromoles per milliliter).
msmarco_passage_06_762882567	This can result in increased levels of methylmalonic acid in the bloodstream. Therefore, the presence of high methylmalonic acid levels in people with kidney disease may not indicate the presence of a vitamin B-12 deficiency. High levels of methylmalonic acid are also common during pregnancy. The results of the test must be discussed with your doctor.
msmarco_passage_06_762884274	Additional testing may be needed for people who have both normal B-12 levels and clinical symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency. One test that can be used is the methylmalonic acid test.
msmarco_passage_06_762884584	What is the purpose of the test? Methylmalonic acid is a compound that reacts with vitamin B-12 to produce coenzyme A (CoA). Coenzyme A is essential to normal cellular function. When vitamin B-12 deficiencies occur, methylmalonic acid levels increase.
msmarco_passage_06_771703068	What To Think About. Folic acid levels can be high in people who lack vitamin B12. A folic acid test is often done at the same time as a vitamin B12 test.

msmarco_passage_24_203994696	These findings usually prompt vitamin B12 and folate testing and may lead to methylmalonic acid testing (an early indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency). When a person has a decreased vitamin B12 level and increased methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, an intrinsic factor antibody test is typically ordered.
msmarco_passage_24_205382632	Methylmalonic acid is an organic acid and abnormally high levels of organic acids in the blood (organic acidemia), urine (organic aciduria), the brain, and other tissues lead to general metabolic acidosis. Acidosis typically occurs when arterial pH falls below 7. 35.
msmarco_passage_24_205383441	Methylmalonic acid test. The methylmalonic acid blood test measures the amount of methylmalonic acid in the blood. The methylmalonic acid test may be used to help diagnose an early or mild vitamin B12 deficiency. It may be ordered by itself or along with a homocysteine test as a follow-up to a vitamin B12 test result that is in the lower end of the normal range.
msmarco_passage_24_205384369	If there is not enough B12 available, then the methylmalonic acid level begins to rise, resulting in an increase of methylmalonic acid in the blood and urine. Measuring methylmalonic acid in the blood or urine can help detect early vitamin B12 deficiency.
msmarco_passage_24_205385166	Methylmalonic acid is a very sensitive test in indicating a B12 deficiency. It is more specific than homocysteine and is the confirmatory test of choice for a B12 deficiency. Occasionally, specialized methylmalonic acid testing may be ordered to help diagnose methylmalonic acidemia, a rare inherited metabolic disorder.
msmarco_passage_24_205385941	Methylmalonic acid is usually ordered, sometimes along with a homocysteine test, when a vitamin B12 test result is in the lower portion of the normal range, especially when a person has symptoms associated with B12 deficiency.
msmarco_passage_24_205386715	An methylmalonic acid test also may be ordered as a follow-up to an elevated homocysteine level if the two tests are not ordered together. Methylmalonic acid testing may be ordered when a health practitioner suspects that an acutely ill infant may have inherited methylmalonic acidemia.
msmarco_passage_24_205387559	Elevated methylmalonic acid. If methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels are increased and the vitamin B12 level is mildly decreased, then an early or mild B12 deficiency may be present. This may indicate a decrease in available B12 at the tissue level. An elevated methylmalonic acid test may indicate a B12 deficiency, but the amount of methylmalonic acid measured does not necessarily reflect the severity of the deficiency, its likelihood of progressing, or the presence or severity of any symptoms.
msmarco_passage_24_205389529	What is methylmalonic acid. Methylmalonic acid is a malonic acid derivative which is a vital intermediate in the metabolism of fat and protein. Methylmalonic acid is a substance produced in very small amounts and is necessary for human metabolism and energy production. In one step of metabolism, vitamin B12 (cobalamin) promotes the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA (a form of methylmalonic acid) to succinyl Coenzyme A by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor.
msmarco_passage_24_205390176	If there is not enough vitamin B12 available, then the methylmalonic acid concentration begins to rise, resulting in an increase of methylmalonic acid in the blood and urine. The measurement of elevated amounts of methylmalonic acid in the blood or urine serves as a sensitive and early indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency.
msmarco_passage_24_205391769	Because a relatively large amount of the B12 found in the blood is bound to proteins and is not biologically active, some in the medical community think that methylmalonic acid may be a better measure of bioavailable B12 than the usual vitamin B12 test.
msmarco_passage_24_208574459	Vitamin B12 is converted into adenosylcobalamin, which converts L-methylmalonic acid to succinyl coenzyme A; hence, a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption in the intestine can cause an excess of methylmalonic acid (MMA) within the body. The Schilling test is rarely, if ever, done today. Currently, Schilling test is not readily available in most countries as a means of diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency.

msmarco_passage_26_233988470	Why It's Done. The somatomedin C test is primarily ordered to check for pituitary gland disorders  and abnormalities in growth hormone production. Symptoms such as short stature or  excessive growth (gigantism) may warrant a somatomedin C test. The test may also be used to assess a child's nutritional status, because malnutrition  may reduce somatomedin C levels.
msmarco_passage_26_372734184	Low Methylmalonic Acid. Genetics. Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is normally made in the body in tiny amounts. It builds up only in the absence of vitamin B12 and can be used as a functional indicator of vitamin B12 status. However, testing MMA is still controversial and has some limitations.
msmarco_passage_26_372735585	Methylmalonic acid test is not a part of routine health check-ups.

msmarco_passage_15_650401688	During the spring, red-orange is a great color. What crankbait color you use will vary depending on the water conditions. On a bright sunny day with crystal clear water, you want a natural looking bait. That means a muted red crawfish pattern that is a little darker works well.
msmarco_passage_15_650402943	Why is spring a hot time for bass on crawfish lures? The mating season of the spring has the crawfish out and active, and more susceptible to becoming a meal.

Crawfish are an important food source for bass on most bodies of water and craw-patterns can be a great option to catch big bass. There are specific windows where craw baits will yield you the best results. What is the best time of year to fish with crawfish baits and lures for bass?
msmarco_passage_22_850848031	In lakes with trout, big bass will be far from shore in deep water gorging on trout. In other lakes or rivers, schools of shad or shiners will be the ideal food source. The primary food source can also be bluegill and frogs in waterways that lack schooling baitfish or trout.
msmarco_passage_22_850848447	Don’t present moving craw baits at these summer bass. Instead, try pumpkin-colored jigs with a soft plastic as the trailer. You can also fish with craw or creature-style soft plastics Carolina or Texas-rigged. Match the color of the water. If the water is clear, go with a pumpkin, brown, or green and black flake color.
msmarco_passage_22_850848937	Early Fall. Early fall can also be a good time to try out some finesse craw baits In early autumn, many crawfish will molt their shells. For a brief window, they are protected only by a softer shell making them very vulnerable and ideal for bass. While these crawfish are vulnerable, they will not be out and about.
msmarco_passage_22_850849405	They will instead be reserved and trying to hunker down near protective rock and logs. Moving red baits don’t make any sense this time of year so focus on creature baits, jigs, and craw plastics. Fish these baits in and around structure, rock, or logs.
msmarco_passage_22_850849803	It should be noted that on lakes or rivers with schooling baitfish like shad, crawfish will very quickly take a back seat for bass. The bass will start heavily gorging on shad to fatten up for winter and start ignoring craws unless they are an easy target.
msmarco_passage_22_850850188	Largemouth Bass. Crawfish do make up a substantial part of a largemouth bass’s diet. As bass mature and come into adulthood, their diet shifts towards larger prey items like fish, craws, and frogs. A 2009 study by Christensen & Moore shows this shift towards craws and other large baits as they mature.
msmarco_passage_22_850850648	Focus on fast-moving crankbaits (lipless, squarebill, and deep-diving) in and around shallower cover, rocks, and grass. These bass will move into these shallower locations as water temps begin to warm. Once the schooling baitfish arrive in shallow water, smallmouth will shift focus away from crawfish.
msmarco_passage_22_850851091	Smallmouth bass will still eat crayfish all summer long but more as a target of opportunity rather than the preferred prey. In summer, you’re best bet is attacking bass with brown, pumpkin, or green tube jigs, small creature baits, or soft-plastics. Go with a more finesse approach.
msmarco_passage_22_850851519	In early fall, the crawfish bite will really start picking up again. You can really do well using jigs and tube jigs in early autumn. Just pay close attention to shad and other baitfish moving into shallow water. Once smallmouth bass start focusing on fish again, the craw baits need to put away until winter.
msmarco_passage_22_850851981	Craw Color Selection Guide. The most important thing to remember with colors for craw baits is to match the water clarity with the color. You obviously want a color that bass can easily see in the water. In very clear water, go with as subtle and natural colors as possible.
msmarco_passage_22_850852408	While you can catch bass with craw lures all year long, late winter through early spring and early fall will be the best times to fish aggressively with craw lures. The key is focusing on times of the year when crawfish are most vulnerable and baitfish can be in limited supply for bass to choose. The exact type of lure you choose is less important than selecting a color of red or orange that will be ideal for the water clarity.
msmarco_passage_22_850852975	Now if you start getting into murkier or stained water with less than 6 feet of visibility, switch to brighter or bolder reds and oranges. These colors will be easier for bass to pick up in less clear water. In muddy water with less than 1 foot of visibility, go with bold orange coloration.
msmarco_passage_22_850853407	For finesse-style baits like jigs, tube jigs, soft-plastics, and creature baits, pumpkin, brown, and green colors work great in clear water. In dirtier water, you can’t beat dark blue or black as these colors will be easily seen in muddy water.
msmarco_passage_22_850853785	Shallow Grass. In late winter and early spring, shallow grass is the best place to throw moving craw baits for big hungry fish. Lipless crankbaits in ghost or clear red color work phenomenally over shallow grass. Burn that bait fast and then add quick pauses in your reel turns.
msmarco_passage_22_850855121	Craws can catch bass all year long, but throwing craw-style baits in late winter and early spring before baitfish start schooling up in shallow water will be your best bet. Fish clear “ghost” red baits when the water is clear and for muddy or stained water, selecting bolder reds or oranges lures will be a better option.

msmarco_passage_00_435473092	In addition, since certain cells respond predominantly to input from one eye, there are ocular (eye) dominance columns as well (Hubel & Wiesel, 1968, 1974). A similar columnar arrangement in regard to somesthetic input is maintained in the parietal lobe.
msmarco_passage_00_435477316	For example, and as detailed in chapters 20 and 21, the superior parietal lobe also contains visual cortex and receives peripheral and lower visual input via the optic radiations, whereas the middle and inferior temporal lobes receive foveal and upper visual field input via these fibers (Doty, 1983; Kaas & Krubitzer 2015; Lin et al. 1982; Sereno et al. 2015).
msmarco_passage_00_435478666	For example, as based on functional imaging, a cortical area located at the lateral occipital temporal border (referred to as V5), can be independently activated by rapid visual motion, whereas parallel activation of area 17 (also referred to as V1) is not always observed (Zeki, 2007).
msmarco_passage_00_435479481	For example, the inferior-medial temporal lobe is concerned with form perception and the analysis of emotional-motivational significance and transmits this information to area 7. Area 7 is involved in visual attention, visual fixation, and the analysis of distance, depth, and objects within grasping distance. Area V5 (at the temporal occipital border) perceive motion.

msmarco_passage_01_642896563	It is lacking a true vascular system, and its dominant gametophyte generation is alternating with a dependent sporophyte generation, so it's a bryophyte. Because its lobeless leaf-like structures are attached to the branches in spiral patterns, it's a moss.
msmarco_passage_02_506773688	In seedless non-vascular plants, or bryophytes (mosses), the haploid gametophyte is larger than the sporophyte (the plant structure that you see is the gametophyte); this is a gametophyte-dominated life cycle. The sporophyte is attached to and dependent on the gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_02_555867028	During evolution, the sporophytic stage becomes dominant over the gametophytic stage. The primitive non-vascular plants like bryophytes consist of a sporophyte that completely depends on their gametophytes. In pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, the sporophyte is the dominant stage.
msmarco_passage_02_555869908	Algae and bryophytes contain a dominant gametophytic stage. The sporophyte is dominant on pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. The gametophyte represents the sexual phase and sporophyte represents the asexual phase of the plant life cycle.
msmarco_passage_03_146090210	Regardless of this, the dominant diploid stage of the life cycle will produce flowers, which are specialized structures for reproduction. The female parts of the flower will produce megaspores, and the male parts will develop microspores, continuing this cycle.
msmarco_passage_03_147934224	Reproductive Life. In the bryophyte life cycle, water is necessary for reproduction. The life cycle has two distinct parts. In the diploid stage, sperm and eggs, produced by the gametophyte, are able to join as sperm moves through water, using a special tail-like structure.

msmarco_passage_05_668250486	The dominant plant is a gametophyte, which is not differentiated into root, true stems, or true leaves. There are no vascular tissues or mechanical tissues. Bryophytes include mosses and worts. Pterophytes grow in moist, shady places. The dominant phase is a sporophytic phase.
msmarco_passage_05_669754570	Gametophyte represents the sexual phase of the plant life cycle. It is a haploid phase that is dominant in lower plants such as bryophytes and algae. With evolution, gametophyte generation has become smaller and restricted into single cells. Gametophyte phase begins with the formation of haploid spores by sporophytes.
msmarco_passage_05_669757523	Also, in Bryophytes, Psilophytes, and Lycophytes, the gametophyte stage is larger and dominant, and the sporophyte stage grows on the gametophyte stage. In angiosperms and gymnosperms, the sporophyte phase is the larger and dominant comparatively, while the gametophyte phase is comparatively smaller. Hence, it is another difference between sporophyte and gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_05_669759330	In bryophytes and algae, gametophyte generation is dominant while in pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms, the gametophyte generation is dominant. Thus, this summarizes the difference between sporophyte and gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_05_671060020	The key difference between Bryophytes and Ferns is that the bryophytes are nonvascular plants having a dominant gametophyte generation while the ferns are vascular plants having a dominant sporophyte generation. Through the evolutionary process, earth colonized with vascular plants and non-vascular plants which are called primitive land plants.
msmarco_passage_05_671060898	When considering true ferns (Pteridophyta), similar to bryophytes, these ferns also show alternative generations. However, unlike bryophytes, ferns have a dominant sporophyte generation that is diploid. Gametophyte generation represents by a prothallus, which is green and photosynthetic produced by a spore of the sporophyte.
msmarco_passage_05_671063169	Furthermore, bryophytes do not have true leaves while ferns have true leaves. Not only that, bryophytes do not have true stems and roots while ferns have true stems and roots. Thus, it is also a difference between bryophytes and ferns. In bryophytes, gametophyte generation is dominating while in ferns, sporophyte generation is dominating.
msmarco_passage_05_671065151	However, both groups show alternate of generation. But in bryophytes, gametophyte generation is dominant while in ferns, sporophyte generation is dominant. This is the summary of the difference between bryophytes and ferns.
msmarco_passage_05_700150246	Algae: The sporophytes and the gametophytes in algae may be isomorphic (similar appearing) or anisomosphic. In this group of organisms gametophyte is dominant while the sporophyte is restricted to the zygote (2). Bryophytes: Gametophyte is long lived among this group of plants.
msmarco_passage_06_155342046	In ferns, horsetails, conifers and angiosperms, the diploid sporophyte is the dominant phase of the life cycle, the plant body we usually see. In mosses and liverworts, the main plant body is the gametophyte. See also alternation of generations.

msmarco_passage_09_610195781	The mature gametophyte produces both male and female gametes, which join to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into the diploid sporophyte, which extends from the gametophyte and produces haploid spores through meiosis. Once the spores germinate, they produce new gametophyte plants and the cycle continues.
msmarco_passage_09_610196657	The dominant phase in the tracheophyte life cycle is the diploid (sporophyte) stage. The gametophytes are very small and cannot exist independent of the parent plant.

msmarco_passage_11_233110103	The earliest land plants were most likely bryophytes. Bryophytes lack vascular tissue and have life cycles dominated by the gametophyte phase, as shown in Figure 7. The lack of conducting cells limits the size of the plants, generally keeping them under 5 inches high.
msmarco_passage_11_238117254	Similar to plants, the moss lifecycle is completed in two distinct stages - the gametophyte and the sporophyte. The term that describes this type of life history is called alternation of heteromorphic generations. In vascular plants the dominant stage of this lifecycle is the diploid generation. In mosses, the dominant stage is the haploid generation (the gametophyte).
msmarco_passage_12_540375302	Also Know, in which group of plants is the Gametophyte the dominant stage? Thus, the gametophyte stage is dominant in the more primitive (nonvascular) plants (bryophytes), whereas the sporophyte is the dominant phase in the life cycle of higher (i.e., vascular) plants.
msmarco_passage_12_540376203	Which life stage in alternation of generations is dominant in gymnosperms and angiosperms plants with seeds )? In bryophytes, such as mosses and liverworts, the gametophyte is the dominant life phase, whereas in angiosperms and gymnosperms the sporophyte is dominant.
msmarco_passage_13_381123140	Definition of Bryophytes. The name ‘Bryophytes’ is a traditional name, which is used to all such plants or embryophytes that do not have true vascular tissue and hence called “non-vascular plants”, which means they do not have xylem and phloem. As their gametophytic generation is dominating, they produce gametes.
msmarco_passage_13_382052201	Bryophytes or non-vascular plants show alternation of generations and cycle completes between sexual and asexual stages. The thallus is the gametophyte of the plant which develops male and female organs. The gametophyte phase is the sexual phase and produces gametes. The photosynthesis takes place in the plant gametophyte and so non-vascular plants spend most of their time in the gametophyte phase and even the sporophytes are dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition.
msmarco_passage_13_400772056	Multiple advantages developed in the sporophyte stage of plants as they evolved from simple gametophyte-dominant bryophyte ancestors to the vast array of much more successful and dominant ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. Shift from gametophyte-dominated life cycle (in bryophytes) to sporophyte-dominated life cycle.
msmarco_passage_13_401814289	Gametophyte. The dominant generation in bryophyte is gametophyte. The vegetative plant body is a gametophyte. It has smaller size. Plant body: The plants are multicellular. They have simple thallus. Some may be differentiated into simple leaves and stem. Vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) are absent. Roots are absent.
msmarco_passage_13_403234311	D is correct. All bryophytes have a dominant gametophyte stage in their life cycle. During this stage, the plant is haploid and the sex organs that produce the gametes are developed. Bryophytes are unique compared to many other plant species in that they remain in this stage for long periods.
msmarco_passage_13_409438263	These plants live in moist environments so that they can have free and constant access to water. Under this plant classification, the sporophyte generation is not dominant and is often smaller and more short-lived than the gametophyte generation. Examples of non-vascular sporophytes are as follows: 1. Bryophytes.
msmarco_passage_13_412194312	Leave a Comment / Botany / By Supriya N. The life cycle of bryophytes has two alternations of generations, one is haploid gametophyte generation and the other is diploid saprophytic generation. In both the life cycle, the bryophytes possess different morphology and physiological functions. Between these two alternations of generation, the haploid gametophyte phase lasts longer or dominates the diploid saprophytic phase.
msmarco_passage_14_370483826	The ability of the plants to reproduce sexually and asexually helps them to adapt to different environments. The alternation of generations depends upon the type of the plant. In Bryophytes, the dominant generation is haploid and the gametophyte comprises the main plant. In tracheophytes, the dominant generation is diploid and the sporophyte comprises the main plant.
msmarco_passage_14_389084000	Plants lack the vascular system (xylem, phloem) Bryophytes show alternation of generation between independent gametophyte with sex organs, which produces sperm and eggs and dependent sporophyte which contains spores. The dominant part of the plant body is gametophyte which is haploid.
msmarco_passage_14_389163384	In some, the gametophyte is dominant and free-living and the sporophyte is a small and short-lived phase, which is dependent on gametophytes, e.g. Bryophytes. In pteridophytes, the sporophyte is the independent and free-living dominant stage. It alternates with short-lived gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_14_87629737	From A. W. Haupt, Plant Morphology, 1953. So in bryophytes, which are indeed well-adapted to creeping around in the shade, the gametophyte is the dominant plant, while the sporophyte is tiny, but in the tall-growing vascular plants, the sporophyte is the dominant plant, while the gametophyte is tiny.
msmarco_passage_15_611630807	The life cycle of higher plants is dominated by the sporophyte stage, with the gametophyte borne on the sporophyte. In ferns, the gametophyte is free-living and very distinct in structure from the diploid sporophyte. In bryophytes, such as mosses, the haploid gametophyte is more developed than the sporophyte.
msmarco_passage_17_426059677	The moss life cycle. Mosses are considered more primitive plants than ferns, but they do still have an alternation of generations with a diploid sporophyte that alternates with a haploid gametophyte. Mosses are in the Division Bryophyta and the gametophyte is the dominant stage of the life cycle. The morphology of a moss plant is a little different from that of more advanced plants.

The gametophyte (haploid) structures are shown in green, the sporophyte (diploid) in brown. Like all land plants (embryophytes), bryophytes have life cycles with alternation of generations. In each cycle, a haploid gametophyte, each of whose cells contains a fixed number of unpaired chromosomes, alternates with a diploid sporophyte, whose cell contain two sets of paired chromosomes.
msmarco_passage_19_56101998	Bryophytes. In bryophytes ( mosses, liverworts, and hornworts ), the gametophyte is the most visible stage of the life cycle. The bryophyte gametophyte is longer lived, nutritionally independent, and the sporophytes are attached to the gametophytes and dependent on them.
msmarco_passage_20_424525171	The alternate generation, the gametophyte, produces gametes, eggs and/or sperm. A gametophyte can be monoicous (bisexual), producing both eggs and sperm or dioicous (unisexual), either female (producing eggs) or male (producing sperm). In the bryophytes ( liverworts, mosses and hornworts ), the sexual gametophyte is the dominant generation.
msmarco_passage_22_456950510	The union of two gametes during fertilization produces a diploid zygote, which divides mitotically to form a new sporophyte. Thus, in the higher (i.e., vascular) plants the sporophyte is the dominant phase in the life cycle, whereas in the more primitive nonvascular plants (bryophytes) the gametophyte remains dominant.

msmarco_passage_29_231627496	In seedless non-vascular plants, or bryophytes (mosses), the haploid gametophyte is larger than the sporophyte (the plant structure that you see is the gametophyte); this is a gametophyte-dominated life cycle. The sporophyte is attached to and dependent on the gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_29_589528444	Both bryophytes and pteridophytes exhibit alteration of generations. The gametophyte is dominant in bryophytes whereas the sporophyte is dominant in pteridophytes. Both dominant generations are autotrophs. The main difference between bryophytes and pteridophytes is that the plant body of bryophytes is not differentiated into root, stem, and leaves whereas the plant body of pteridophytes is differentiated into root, stem, and leaves.
msmarco_passage_29_589530368	What are Bryophytes. Bryophytes are a division of non-vascular land plants, which are classified under the kingdom of Plantae. They exhibit alteration of generations where the gametophyte is dominant upon the sporophyte. The gametophyte is haploid and produces spores. They are mostly autotrophs.
msmarco_passage_29_589530830	They live in moist and shady places. They grow up to several millimeters in general. The prominent phase of the life cycle of bryophytes is the gametophyte, which is haploid. The sporophyte germinates on the gametophyte. The plant body of bryophytes is not differentiated into root, stem, and leaves.

Gametophyte is the prominent stage of the life cycle of bryophytes while sporophyte is the prominent stage of the life cycle of tracheophytes. Furthermore, the prominent stage of life cycle of bryophytes is haploid while the prominent stag of the life cycle of tracheophytes is diploid.
msmarco_passage_29_589535634	Conclusion. Bryophytes, which lack a vascular system, are the most primitive type of plant kingdom. The prominent life stage of bryophytes is the haploid gametophyte. On the other hand, tracheophytes are the well-organized type of plants with a vascular system. The sporophyte is the prominent life stage of tracheophytes.
msmarco_passage_29_593124201	During evolution, the sporophytic stage becomes dominant over the gametophytic stage. The primitive non-vascular plants like bryophytes consist of a sporophyte that completely depends on their gametophytes. In pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, the sporophyte is the dominant stage.
msmarco_passage_29_593127088	Algae and bryophytes contain a dominant gametophytic stage. The sporophyte is dominant on pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. The gametophyte represents the sexual phase and sporophyte represents the asexual phase of the plant life cycle.
msmarco_passage_29_595181223	They asexually reproduce by producing spores. The sexual reproduction only occurs in a wet environment; hence, both liverworts and mosses show alternation of generations. Liverworts and mosses differ in the morphology of the haploid gametophyte. The gametophyte is the prominent stage of the life cycle of bryophytes.
msmarco_passage_29_605016800	Moreover, the gametophyte of bryophytes and algae is the dominant phase of the life cycle while in other plants, the dominant phase of the life cycle is the sporophyte. Also, some bryophytes including liverworts develop male and female gametophytes separately by the germination of microspores and megaspores respectively.
msmarco_passage_29_606207143	Liverworts and hornworts are two divisions of bryophytes. Both undergo an alteration of generations. Also, their prominent stage of life is the haploid gametophyte. Therefore, the diploid sporophyte occurs on top of the gametophyte.

msmarco_passage_32_178532427	Like all land plants ( embryophytes ), bryophytes have life cycle s with alternation of generations. A bryophyte has two forms that have different numbers of chromosomes. The haploid form has unpaired chromosomes. It is called a gametophyte. People often write "1n" for haploid.
msmarco_passage_32_178533301	This stalk is often brown. A structure called the sporangium is at the top of the stalk. The sporangium is diploid too. It makes spores that are haploid in a process called meiosis. When the spores land on the ground, the cycle begins again. Life cycle of a dioicous bryophyte. Bryophytes are "gametophyte dominant.".

In mosses the haploid gametophyte is the dominant generation, whereas in ferns the diploid sporophyte is the dominant generation.
msmarco_passage_37_77852196	When a male reproductive cell ( sperm) produced by a gametophyte fuses with a female reproductive cell ( egg) produced by a gametophyte of the same species, the result is a diploid cell called a zygote. This zygote develops and grows via mitosis into a sporophyte, thereby completing the plant’s life cycle. Moss (Leucolepis acanthoneuron) in its gametophyte phase (the dominant phase in the life cycle of bryophytes).
msmarco_passage_37_792850071	Bryophytes are examples of haploid-dominant organisms. The rest of this page is devoted mostly to the subject of gametophyte development, from spore through to the leafy or thallose stage. This page finishes with some interesting web links. There is a separate SPOROPHYTE DEVELOPMENT page.
msmarco_passage_37_792859431	In between there is typically the part that will become the stalk (or seta) that supports the spore capsule, though in a number of bryophytes the seta is short or even non-existent. By the time the sporophyte has matured the spore capsule will contain haploid spores. The following diagram gives one example of a bryophyte life cycle, that of the moss Funaria hygrometrica.
msmarco_passage_37_792885833	All plants have gametophytes and sporophytes, but there is a considerable difference between the major plant groups as to which is the dominant stage. In the bryophytes the gametophyte is dominant. Gametophytes are persistent and, from time to time, gives rise to sporophytes.
msmarco_passage_37_792886654	Roughly speaking, ferns are in between. You can find out more in the LIFE CYCLE SECTION. In that section you'll find a description of the bryophyte life cycle as well as a comparison between life cycles of the bryophytes and the other plant groups and the differing roles of gametophyte and sporophyte.
msmarco_passage_38_289490307	This cycle is known as alternation of generations or alternation of phases. Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) have a dominant gametophyte phase on which the adult sporophyte is dependent for nutrition.
msmarco_passage_39_514532327	In algae and bryophytes the somatic or vegetative plant body is a gametophyte which is dominant and visible. But in pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms the visible plant body is a sporophyte which is dominant and the gametophyte generation is less conspicuous (Fig. 4.2). In the life cycle diagram, the dominant generation should be placed in the top half of the cycle.
msmarco_passage_39_808771055	Here both the phases are multicellular. This life cycle is found in bryophytes and pteridophytes. The diploid sporophyte is the dominating phase and photosynthetic in pteridophytes while the haploid gametophyte with photosynthetic phase is found in bryophytes.
msmarco_passage_39_808779798	These are also called amphibians of the plant kingdom. They hold water as sponges. They live in moist and damp places. The photosynthetic phase of bryophytes is haploid gametophytic generation while the sporophytic phase is short-lived and nutritionally dependent on the gametophytic phase.
msmarco_passage_39_832889653	Bryophytes : Alternation of Generations. In common with all land plants and some advanced algae such as Laminaria, bryophytes exhibit alternation of generations. Two types of organism, a haploid gametophyte generation and a diploid sporophyte generation, alternate in the life cycle.
msmarco_passage_39_832891254	In all Bryophytes the gametophyte generation is dominant. In all other land plants the sporophyte generation is dominant. It is customary to place the dominant generation in the top half of the life cycle diagram. The figure given above summarises the life cycle of a typical Bryophyte.
msmarco_passage_40_115347772	Angiosperms are vascular plants, and all vascular plants have a life cycle in which the sporophyte phase (vegetative body) is the dominant phase and the gametophyte phase remains diminutive. In the nonvascular plants, such as the bryophytes, the gametophyte phase is dominant over the sporophyte phase. In bryophytes, the gametophyte produces its food by photosynthesis (is autotrophic) while the nongreen sporophyte is dependent on the food produced by the gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_40_129206162	Thus, the gametophyte stage is dominant in the more primitive (nonvascular) plants ( bryophytes ), whereas the sporophyte is the dominant phase in the life cycle of higher (i.e., vascular) plants. In algae, the dominant phase often depends on environmental conditions, though some species have determinant life cycles.

msmarco_passage_40_142748462	Thus, in the higher (i.e., vascular) plants the sporophyte is the dominant phase in the life cycle, whereas in the more primitive nonvascular plants ( bryophytes) the gametophyte remains dominant. The dominant phase in algae often depends on environmental conditions, though some species have determinant life cycles and are commonly gametophyte-dominant.
msmarco_passage_41_379512872	In mosses, the gametophyte is the dominant stage of the life cycle; in ferns, the sporophyte is the dominant stage of the life cycle.
msmarco_passage_41_625228576	The life cycle of bryophytes consists of two distinct phases– the gametophytic phase and the sporophytic phase. The haploid gametophyte is dominant, long lived, green and independent whereas the diploid sporophyte is short lived and dependent upon the gametophyte. The two phases are morphologically distinct.
msmarco_passage_41_661660789	The life cycles of all bryophytes are uniform, and although the gametophyte generation is the most familiar aspect of the life cycle, neither the sporophyte nor the gametophyte generation is dominant.

msmarco_passage_43_515881263	The gametophyte is dominant in bryophytes and algae. Some bryophytes like liverworts etc. develop female and male gametophytes separately by the germination of megaspores and microspores respectively. In ferns, the gametophyte is not the prominent form of the plant body, but it is also independent of its sporophyte.
msmarco_passage_43_515882632	The most primitive non-vascular plants, i.e. bryophytes consist of a sporophyte generation that completely depends on its gametophytic generation. But, in pteridophytes and higher plants, i.e. gymnosperms, and angiosperms, the sporophyte is the dominant form.
msmarco_passage_43_527772439	Vascular tissues are absent in bryophytes while seedless vascular plants have true vascular tissues. However, both groups show alternation of generation. Gametophytes are dominant in bryophytes, while sporophytes are dominant in seedless vascular plants. Thus, this is also a difference between bryophytes and seedless vascular plants.
msmarco_passage_43_527774310	Both show alternation of generations. But, in bryophytes, the gametophyte is dominant while in seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte is dominant. Moreover, bryophytes lack true stem, roots and leaves while seedless vascular plants have true stem, roots and leaves. Thus, this summarizes the difference between bryophytes and seedless vascular plants.
msmarco_passage_43_552221420	The dominant plant is a gametophyte, which is not differentiated into root, true stems, or true leaves. There are no vascular tissues or mechanical tissues. Bryophytes include mosses and worts. Pterophytes grow in moist, shady places. The dominant phase is a sporophytic phase.
msmarco_passage_43_558645816	Gametophyte represents the sexual phase of the plant life cycle. It is a haploid phase that is dominant in lower plants such as bryophytes and algae. With evolution, gametophyte generation has become smaller and restricted into single cells. Gametophyte phase begins with the formation of haploid spores by sporophytes.
msmarco_passage_43_558648769	Also, in Bryophytes, Psilophytes, and Lycophytes, the gametophyte stage is larger and dominant, and the sporophyte stage grows on the gametophyte stage. In angiosperms and gymnosperms, the sporophyte phase is the larger and dominant comparatively, while the gametophyte phase is comparatively smaller. Hence, it is another difference between sporophyte and gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_43_558650576	In bryophytes and algae, gametophyte generation is dominant while in pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms, the gametophyte generation is dominant. Thus, this summarizes the difference between sporophyte and gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_43_563527027	The key difference between Bryophytes and Ferns is that the bryophytes are nonvascular plants having a dominant gametophyte generation while the ferns are vascular plants having a dominant sporophyte generation. Through the evolutionary process, earth colonized with vascular plants and non-vascular plants which are called primitive land plants.
msmarco_passage_43_563527905	When considering true ferns (Pteridophyta), similar to bryophytes, these ferns also show alternative generations. However, unlike bryophytes, ferns have a dominant sporophyte generation that is diploid. Gametophyte generation represents by a prothallus, which is green and photosynthetic produced by a spore of the sporophyte.
msmarco_passage_43_563530176	Furthermore, bryophytes do not have true leaves while ferns have true leaves. Not only that, bryophytes do not have true stems and roots while ferns have true stems and roots. Thus, it is also a difference between bryophytes and ferns. In bryophytes, gametophyte generation is dominating while in ferns, sporophyte generation is dominating.

msmarco_passage_61_239218741	Bryophyte Generations. Bryophytes are nonvascularized plants that are still dependent on a moist environment for survival (see Plant Classification, Bryophytes . Like all plants, the bryophyte life cycle goes through both haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) stages. The gametophyte comprises the main plant (the green moss or liverwort), while the diploid sporophyte is much smaller and is attached to the gametophyte.
msmarco_passage_61_239219324	The haploid stage, in which a multicellular haploid gametophyte develops from a spore and produces haploid gametes, is the dominant stage in the bryophyte life cycle. The mature gametophyte produces both male and female gametes, which join to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into the diploid sporophyte, which extends from the gametophyte and produces haploid spores through meiosis.
msmarco_passage_61_239220340	The gametophytes are very small and cannot exist independent of the parent plant. The reproductive structures of the sporophyte (cones in gymnosperms and flowers in angiosperms), produce two different kinds of haploid spores: microspores (male) and megaspores (female).
msmarco_passage_61_239237400	The haploid stage, in which a multicellular haploid gametophyte develops from a spore and produces haploid gametes, is the dominant stage in the bryophyte life cycle. This stands in direct contrast to the tracheophyte life cycle, in which the diploid stage is dominant.
msmarco_passage_64_463600069	The gametophyte stage is characterized by a single to a few-celled haploid gametophyte. Bryophytes and Pteridophytes show an intermediate condition called the haplo-diplontic life cycle, where phases are multicellular. But the dominant phase differs.
msmarco_passage_65_725400684	The alternation of generations depends upon the type of plant. The dominant generation is haploid and the gametophyte comprises the main plant in Bryophytes. In tracheophytes, the generation that dominates is diploid and the sporophyte has the main plant. The plants’ life cycle in one of the two generations is dominant over the other.
msmarco_passage_68_843082660	The earliest land plants were most likely bryophytes. Bryophytes lack vascular tissue and have life cycles dominated by the gametophyte phase, as shown in Figure 7. The lack of conducting cells limits the size of the plants, generally keeping them under 5 inches high.

And a boundary at which two plates slide sideways past each other is a transform boundary. Credits: Stephen Marshak (Essentials of Geology) at February 10, 2016.
msmarco_passage_01_434957095	All three types move differently. Normal faults move vertically usually at divergent boundaries. Reverse faults move both vertically and horizontally. When two plates move toward each other there is compression stress on both sides resulting in one rock being pushed up over the other rock.
msmarco_passage_01_572855368	As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the Mantle, earthquakes and volcanos are common near Convergent Boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a Subduction zone or a Continental collision, this depends on the nature of the plates involved.

msmarco_passage_02_460671505	A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. Along these boundaries, earthquakes are common and magma (molten rock) rises from the Earth’s mantle to the surface, solidifying to create new oceanic crust.
msmarco_passage_02_460671872	The Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Pacific Ring of Fire are two examples of divergent plate boundaries. When two plates come together, it is known as a convergent boundary.
msmarco_passage_02_460672600	Magma rises into and through the other plate, solidifying into granite, the rock that makes up the continents. Thus, at convergent boundaries, continental crust is created and oceanic crust is destroyed. Two plates sliding past each other forms a transform plate boundary.
msmarco_passage_02_460673390	Rocks that line the boundary are pulverized as the plates grind along, creating a linear fault valley or undersea canyon. Earthquakes are common along these faults. In contrast to convergent and divergent boundaries, crust is cracked and broken at transform margins, but is not created or destroyed.
msmarco_passage_02_460682735	When two plates are moving away from each other, we call this a divergent plate boundary. Along these boundaries, magma rises from deep within the Earth and erupts to form new crust on the lithosphere. Most divergent plate boundaries are underwater and form submarine mountain ranges called oceanic spreading ridges.
msmarco_passage_02_460683192	While the process of forming these mountain ranges is volcanic, volcanoes and earthquakes along oceanic spreading ridges are not as violent as they are at convergent plate boundaries. The third type of plate boundary occurs where tectonic plates slide horizontally past each other. This is known as a transform plate boundary.
msmarco_passage_02_544431271	A transform boundary is the zone between two tectonic plates sliding past on another. At transform boundaries the two tectonic plates grind past each other in a horizontal direction. This movement result in a crack or fracture in the Earth’s crust and is called a fault.

msmarco_passage_04_198994047	The tectonic plates underneath the earths crust are moving, and these plates crash into, and slide against each other. These places where the plates meet are called fault lines. Since the plates are constantly moving, there is a lot of pressure between the plates, and eventually, it needs to be released in the form of an earthquake.
msmarco_passage_04_198994522	When two tectonic plates slide past each other a transform fault is created. This type of fault is known for many earthquakes, yet due to the fault not changing elevation during a seismic event, these faults are not associated normally with tsunami's or volcanoes.
msmarco_passage_04_198994915	When plates move apart or diverge, it is called a normal fault (happens along a divergent boundary). When plates collide or converge, a reverse fault occurs (when the hanging wall pushes up, and the foot wall pushes down). When plates slide past each other, it is called a strike-slip fault, which typically occurs at a transform plate boundary.Also, if you are still having doubts, do more research on strike-slip faults, normal faults, and reverse faults by just typing it in.

msmarco_passage_17_96127321	Plate Tectonic Types: Divergent, Convergent and Transform Plates. Plate boundaries interact with each other in 3 primary ways. The types of plate tectonic boundaries are divergent, convergent, and transform (conservative). DIVERGENT PLATES: Divergent plates pull apart from each other.
msmarco_passage_17_96127751	Plate boundaries can be divergent, convergent, and transform. The Earth is broken up into tectonic plates. They are unusual in shape because they contain both oceanic and continental crust.
msmarco_passage_17_96130540	Transform boundary plates slide across each other. Lastly, conservative (transform) plate boundaries don’t collide into each other nor pull apart. Instead transform plates slide across from each other. We find most transform plates in the ocean basin connecting at mid-ocean ridges.
msmarco_passage_17_96227809	Transform Plate Boundaries: Sliding Plate Tectonics. Conservative or transform plate boundaries slide across from each other without creating or destroying any crust. Transform plate boundaries are one of the 3 plate tectonic boundary types along with divergent and convergent plate types. They don’t have notable features like large chains of mountains.
msmarco_passage_19_475416662	He also conceived of the transform fault, a major plate boundary where two plates move past each other horizontally ( e.g., the San Andreas Fault ). His name was given to two young Canadian submarine volcanoes called the Tuzo Wilson Seamounts.
msmarco_passage_19_753121650	Transform boundaries. Main article: Transform boundary. The San Andreas Fault in California is an active transform boundary. The Pacific Plate (carrying the city of Los Angeles) is moving northwards with respect to the North American Plate.
msmarco_passage_22_465106588	In Plate Tectonic Theory, the lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates, which undergo some large scale motions. The boundary regions between plates are aptly called plate boundaries. Based upon their motions with respect to one another, these plate boundaries are of three kinds: divergent, convergent, and transform.
msmarco_passage_22_465107528	Divergent boundaries – where two plates are moving apart. Transform boundaries – where plates slide passed each other. Click to see full answer. Keeping this in consideration, what are the 3 types of plate boundaries and how do they move? In the theory of plate tectonics, the earth's crust is broken into plates that move around relative to each other.
msmarco_passage_22_468893008	The San Andreas Fault is a place where two tectonic plates touch, the North American and Pacific Plates. What happens at convergent boundaries? A convergent plate boundary is a location where two tectonic plates are moving toward each other, often causing one plate to slide below the other (in a process known as subduction). The collision of tectonic plates can result in earthquakes, volcanoes, the formation of mountains, and other geological events.
msmarco_passage_22_470521343	Thus, at convergent boundaries, continental crust is created and oceanic crust is destroyed. Two plates sliding past each other forms a transform plate boundary. Natural or human-made structures that cross a transform boundary are offset—split into pieces and carried in opposite directions.
msmarco_passage_22_470521780	Also Know, what is created at a transform boundary? Transform boundaries are places where plates slide sideways past each other. At transform boundaries lithosphere is neither created nor destroyed. Many transform boundaries are found on the sea floor, where they connect segments of diverging mid-ocean ridges.
msmarco_passage_22_471901875	There are three kinds of plate tectonic boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform plate boundaries. Also, what does a transform boundary form? Transform boundaries occur where plates are sliding past one another.
msmarco_passage_22_471903366	Just so, where do transform boundaries most commonly occur? Transform Plate Boundaries. Transform Plate Boundaries are locations where two plates slide past one another. The fracture zone that forms a transform plate boundary is known as a transform fault.
msmarco_passage_23_288204559	Subduction. Oceanic-Continental Subduction. Oceanic-Oceanic Subduction. Collisions. References. Convergent boundaries, also called destructive boundaries, are places where two or more plates move toward each other. Convergent boundary movement is divided into two types, subduction and collision, depending on the density of the involved plates. Continental lithosphere is of lower density and thus more buoyant than the underlying asthenosphere.
msmarco_passage_23_288528074	4.6: Convergent Plate Boundaries. Convergent boundaries, where two plates are moving toward each other, are of three types, depending on the type of crust present on either side of the boundary — oceanic or continental. The types are ocean-ocean, ocean-continent, and continent-continent. At an ocean-ocean convergent boundary, one of the plates (oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle) is pushed, or subducted, under the other (Figure 4.6. 1 ).
msmarco_passage_23_288556993	An example of a subduction zone formed from a convergent boundary is the Chile-Peru trench. The last type of plate boundary is the transform boundary, which is where two plates slide past one another. Unlike the other two types of plate boundaries in which new seafloor is created at divergent boundaries and where old seafloor is subducted at convergent boundaries, transform plate boundaries neither create nor destroy the seafloor.
msmarco_passage_23_288586857	4.6: Convergent Plate Boundaries. Convergent boundaries, where two plates are moving toward each other, are of three types, depending on the type of crust present on either side of the boundary — oceanic or continental. The types are ocean-ocean, ocean-continent, and continent-continent. At an ocean-ocean convergent boundary, one of the plates (oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle) is pushed, or subducted, under the other (Figure 4.6. 1 ).
msmarco_passage_23_290887728	Divergent boundary—Plates move apart, spreading horizontally. Convergent boundary—Plates collide, causing either one plate to dive under the other or the edges of both plates to crumple. Transform boundary—Plates slide past one another. An example of a divergent boundary is the one between Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
msmarco_passage_23_291141900	This type of boundary between plates is termed a spreading boundary. At the right, the oceanic lithosphere of plate Y is moving toward the continental lithosphere of plate Z. Where these two plates collide, they form a converging boundary.
msmarco_passage_23_292595112	Types of Tectonic Boundaries. There are three primary types of tectonic boundaries. Divergent boundaries occur where two plates are spreading apart. These boundaries create new oceanic crust. Convergent boundaries occur where two plates are colliding together.
msmarco_passage_23_292595528	Oceanic plates are forced under continental plates, forming subduction zones. Subduction zones destroy oceanic crust. Transform boundaries occur where two plates are sliding horizontally past each other. They are also referred to as conservative boundaries because crust is neither created nor destroyed.

msmarco_passage_23_295313684	Transform Plate Boundaries. Transform Plate Boundaries are locations where two plates slide past one another. The fracture zone that forms a transform plate boundary is known as a transform fault. Most transform faults are found in the ocean basin and connect offsets in the mid-ocean ridges. A smaller number connect mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones.
msmarco_passage_23_296103797	One plate slides horizontally past another. The best-known example is the earthquake-prone San Andreas Fault Zone of California, which marks the boundary between the Pacific and North America Plates. See: Teaching About Transform Plate Boundaries.
msmarco_passage_23_297056757	Mostly, the divergent plate boundaries occur underwater. Transform Plate Boundaries: Occasionally, the tectonic plates move horizontally and they collide with each other. The horizontal collision of plate boundaries is called Transform Plate Boundaries. This kind of plate boundaries occurs below the mountains and rocks.
msmarco_passage_23_567365146	There are three types of plate boundaries; convergent, divergent, and transform. These boundaries affect Earth’s surface and the way it changes. Convergent boundaries occur when two tectonic plates move towards each other. When both of these tectonic plates are continental (made up of land), they form mountain ranges.
msmarco_passage_23_567367762	A divergent boundary is another type of boundary that occurs when two tectonic plates are moving away from each other. These two plates can both be either continental, or oceanic, but not one of each. When two oceanic plates are moving away from each other, seafloor spreading takes place.
msmarco_passage_23_602836538	Lesson Summary. The African tectonic plate (which is a rigid piece of the earth’s crust and are bounded by major fault lines on all sides) is one of the eight major tectonic plates making up the earth’s crust. Tectonic plates are rigid pieces of crust that move on top of the semi-molten mantle. They are bounded by either convergent (where two plates are colliding), divergent (where two plates are moving apart from each other), or transform boundaries (where two plates are moving laterally past each other).The African plate is bounded by divergent boundaries, where the plates are moving apart, and convergent boundaries, where the plates are colliding.
msmarco_passage_23_604284372	This third type of plate boundary is called a transform boundary .The most famous example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California. The San Andreas Fault is the edges of the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.
msmarco_passage_23_802015408	At a destructive plate boundary, two plates move towards one another, destructive plate boundaries create mountains. Conservative (transform) plate boundary. At a conservative plate boundary the plates move horizontally past each other, without creating or destroying any of the earth's crust.
msmarco_passage_26_114495329	Scientists refer to a boundary where two plates are moving away from each other as a divergent boundary. To diverge means to move away from each other. When there is a divergent boundary between two plates of continental crust, a valley can begin to form in the gap that grows between the plates.
msmarco_passage_26_114497080	A boundary where two plates are moving sideways along each other’s edge is called a transform boundary. The movement between plates is sideways at a transform boundary. Since the plates do not move toward each other or away from each other at a transform boundary, no crust is created or destroyed.
msmarco_passage_26_223755635	Convergent boundaries: two plates move towards each other. Sometimes one plate will move under the other. This is called subduction. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental, the oceanic plate will move underneath the continental because it is denser.
msmarco_passage_26_239198396	Definition and Location. The San Andreas Fault is a transform fault in California. A transform fault, also known as transform boundary, is a plate boundary that moves with a horizontal motion. The plates slide past one another along a common straight line. Because of this slippage movement, faults can usually be identified by cracks on the surface.

msmarco_passage_28_195340532	Finally  plates can also slide past each other horizontally. This is called a  transform plate boundary. Plate movement generates stress in the rocks at plate  boundaries. The type of stress is different at each type of plate boundary.
msmarco_passage_28_195364349	In some places, two plates move apart from each other; this is called a diverging plate boundary. Elsewhere two plate move together; this is a converging plate boundary. Finally plates can also slide past each other horizontally. This is called a transform plate boundary.
msmarco_passage_28_336830624	1. Observe: Boundary B is an example of a convergent boundary, where two plates are moving toward one another. When the two plates both contain continental crust, it is called a collisional boundary. Click the left arrow four times to see how the plates move.
msmarco_passage_28_492990960	Convergent plate boundaries are plate boundaries where two plates move toward each other. This type of boundary deforms the crust on one or both plate edges. Subduction Zones. Common features associated with subduction zones include an oceanic trench, an accretionary wedge, a volcanic arc, and a backarc basin.
msmarco_passage_28_864510112	This image shows the three main types of plate boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform. Image courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey. Download image (jpg, 76 KB). The Earth’s lithosphere, which includes the crust and upper mantle, is made up of a series of pieces, or tectonic plates, that move slowly over time.
msmarco_passage_28_864510583	A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. Along these boundaries, earthquakes are common and magma (molten rock) rises from the Earth’s mantle to the surface, solidifying to create new oceanic crust.
msmarco_passage_28_864510950	The Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Pacific Ring of Fire are two examples of divergent plate boundaries. When two plates come together, it is known as a convergent boundary.
msmarco_passage_28_864511678	Magma rises into and through the other plate, solidifying into granite, the rock that makes up the continents. Thus, at convergent boundaries, continental crust is created and oceanic crust is destroyed. Two plates sliding past each other forms a transform plate boundary.
msmarco_passage_28_864512468	Rocks that line the boundary are pulverized as the plates grind along, creating a linear fault valley or undersea canyon. Earthquakes are common along these faults. In contrast to convergent and divergent boundaries, crust is cracked and broken at transform margins, but is not created or destroyed.
msmarco_passage_28_864535359	When two plates are moving away from each other, we call this a divergent plate boundary. Along these boundaries, magma rises from deep within the Earth and erupts to form new crust on the lithosphere. Most divergent plate boundaries are underwater and form submarine mountain ranges called oceanic spreading ridges.
msmarco_passage_29_192188512	The explanation is that plates move in a rotational manner. The North American Plate, for example, rotates counter-clockwise; the Eurasian Plate rotates clockwise. Boundaries between the plates are of three types: divergent (i.e., moving apart), convergent (i.e., moving together), and transform (moving side by side).
msmarco_passage_29_653710296	Transform fault boundaries. The zone between two plates sliding horizontally past one another is  called a transform-fault boundary, or simply a transform boundary. These  boundaries, like the San Andreas fault in California, are marked by strong  earthquakes. Most transform faults are found on the ocean floor.
msmarco_passage_30_26838506	An example of this is the San Andreas Fault in California. This plate boundary is characterized by two plates colliding into one another. Generally, mountains and volcanoes are found on these boundaries. There are three types of convergent boundaries: Oceanic-Continental Convergence, Oceanic-Oceanic Convergence, and Continental-Continental Convergence (Helland, 2005).
msmarco_passage_30_26840645	Two examples of this are the Great Rift Valley in Africa and sea floor spreading. (Right) Transform Plate Boundary: This plate boundary is characterized by two plates sliding horizontally past each other. Transform plate boundaries occur on fault lines and can cause mild to severe earthquakes.
msmarco_passage_30_292347848	Divergent boundaries are formed when two tectonic plates move away from each other. -An Earthquake is when two blocks of the earth (plate tectonics) slide past one another. -The location under the earth where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter. Important Facts.

Is when 2 plates move away from each other. New crust is created , oceans are born and grow wider where plates diverge or pull apart. Volcanoes are also created.
msmarco_passage_30_500557302	As with oceanic-continental convergence, when two oceanic plates converge, one is usually subducted under the other, and in the process a trench is formed. The Marianas Trench (paralleling the Mariana Islands), for example, marks where the fast-moving Pacific Plate converges against the slower moving Philippine Plate.
msmarco_passage_30_500559858	Transform boundaries -- where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other. Plate boundary zones -- broad belts in which boundaries are not well defined and the effects of plate interaction are unclear.

Instead, two tectonic plates grind past each other in a horizontal direction. This kind of boundary results in a fault. A fault is a crack or fracture in the earth's crust that is associated with this movement.
msmarco_passage_30_651422467	3. Transform: two plates move horizontally past one another. Discuss the features, processes, and relative plate motions associated with a divergent plate boundary. A divergent boundary that occurs in the ocean will lead to a mid ocean ridge, in which magma will rise to fill the gap left between the two plates.

msmarco_passage_31_564297888	In a transform plate boundary, two plates will slide past one another. Crust along a transform plate boundary will be cracked and broken, but unlike the other two types of boundaries, it won't create any new crust. Earthquakes are common along these faults. Advertisement.
msmarco_passage_31_577003900	Transform Boundaries. . Transform boundaries are when two tectonic plates slide horizontally past one another. Like divergent boundaries, transform boundaries can occur underwater or on land. When the two plates slide past each other, friction is caused, building up stress in both plates, which then causes an earthquake.
msmarco_passage_31_589548261	Other types of plate boundaries include transform boundaries where the plates slide past each other horizontally, and oblique plate boundaries where there is both a component of transform and convergent or divergent plate motion.
msmarco_passage_31_589606197	As shown above, if the plates are moving away from each other the boundary is called divergent, if they are moving toward each other it’s a convergent boundary, and if they are sliding past each other horizontally, in parallel but opposite directions, then it’s a transform plate boundary. Most of the Earth’s earthquakes occur along plate boundaries as the brittle plates slide and grind past each other as they move.
msmarco_passage_31_591385965	Meanwhile, transform margins are where plates slide past one another, with a famous example being the San Andreas Fault found in California, where the Pacific plate and the North American plate slip past each other with horizontal motion.
msmarco_passage_31_593526794	Convergent plate boundaries are boundaries where two different plates smash into one another/converge on one another. The conversion of plates can happen between two oceanic plates, two continental plates, or an oceanic plate and a continental plate. The plate that is more dense sinks into the mantle in the subduction process.
msmarco_passage_31_593528634	Transform boundaries can lead to the development of strike-slip faults, and unlike other forms of boundaries, there is only horizontal movement and no vertical movement. As the two plates slide past one another they don’t create land or destroy the land, unlike the other two types of boundaries. Since transform boundaries and transform faults neither create land or destroy the land, they are sometimes dubbed “conservative boundaries.”.
msmarco_passage_31_594864752	Transform Fault. The third type of plate boundary is a transform fault. On a transform fault, the plates move in opposite but parallel directions along a fracture. In other words, the plates slide past one another.
msmarco_passage_31_602264711	Continental vs. Continental Convergent Boundaries. When continental plates collide into one another, neither plate can subduct under the other because they are equally light and buoyant. Instead, they are pressed together under intense pressure. This pressure creates buckling and slipping, both vertically and horizontally.
msmarco_passage_31_602266456	Transform Boundaries. Transform boundaries occur where plates are sliding past one another. They are also called conservative boundaries because crust is neither destroyed nor created along them. Transform boundaries are most common on the seafloor, where they form oceanic fracture zones.
msmarco_passage_31_608727495	Transform boundaries also form, like the San Andreas fault zone, where the two sides of the fault move in opposite directions sliding past each other. The Pacific Plate on the west grinds horizontally to the southeast, while the North American plate moves northwest. Cite this Article.
msmarco_passage_31_608790513	Some plates simply slide past one another, forming a transform fault, or simply transform, boundary. Transform fault boundaries are typically found on the ocean floor, where two oceanic plates are sliding past each other. The San Andreas fault in California is a rare type of transform boundary that occurs on land.
msmarco_passage_31_613289509	Convergent boundaries happen where two plates collide together, as seen in the Washington-Oregon coastline of the United States, where the Pacific Plate gets forced beneath the North American plate, creating a subduction zone that destroys oceanic crust. Transform boundaries, also known as conservative boundaries, ensue where two plates slide horizontally past each other.
msmarco_passage_31_622390947	Sometimes called a conservative boundary, because crust is neither created nor destroyed at the boundary, transform boundaries occur in regions where plates are sliding horizontally past each other. Transform boundaries are typically found on the ocean floor but occasionally occur on land.
msmarco_passage_31_622437912	Transform fault boundaries occur when two plates are sliding past each other, as with the San Andreas fault in California. This type of boundary produces earthquakes. The third type of plate boundary is the convergent boundary, which forms when two plates meet head on.
msmarco_passage_31_622569643	Convergent boundary types include oceanic/oceanic, oceanic/continental and continental/continental. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) Convergent boundaries occur where tectonic plates collide, which takes place where two oceanic plates meet, where two continental plates meet or where an oceanic plate meets a continental plate.
msmarco_passage_32_180457391	Convergent boundaries: two plates move towards each other. Sometimes one plate will move under the other. This is called subduction. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental, the oceanic plate will move underneath the continental because it is denser.
msmarco_passage_32_180474043	From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Jump to navigation Jump to search. A convergent plate boundary is the boundary that occur when two plates collide each other either a continental plate with continental plate or oceanic plate. This causes very large earth movements.
msmarco_passage_32_193301072	Convergent boundaries: two plates move towards each other. Sometimes one plate will move under the other. This is called subduction. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental, the oceanic plate will move underneath the continental because it is denser.

msmarco_passage_32_197476535	Convergent boundaries: two plates move towards each other. Sometimes one plate will move under the other. This is called subduction. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental, the oceanic plate will move underneath the continental because it is denser.
msmarco_passage_32_197482178	Convergent boundaries: two plates move towards each other. Sometimes one plate will move under the other. This is called subduction. When an oceanic plate collides with a continental, the oceanic plate will move underneath the continental because it is denser.
msmarco_passage_32_244421558	Transform plate boundaries are most common as offsets along mid-ocean ridges. Transform plate boundaries are different from the other two types. At divergent plate boundaries, new oceanic crust is  formed. At convergent boundaries, old oceanic crust is destroyed.
msmarco_passage_32_480895803	Explanation: When two plate move towards each other they converge or come together. The collision between two plates that are moving towards each other is called a convergent boundary. When an ocean plate meets a continental plate at close to a straight line ( 180 degrees) the result is a subduction zone. There is usually a deep ocean trench off the coast of the continent.
msmarco_passage_32_480896333	There are numerous earthquakes along the line of the contact between the two plates where the ocean plate and its sediments are destroyed. The continent has mountains and volcanos that form along the edge of the continent as a result of the collision.
msmarco_passage_32_480896709	When an ocean plates meets a continental plate at an almost parallel angle a convergent transform plate results, such as the San Andreas fault in California. The collision results in large damaging earthquakes. When two continental plates converge the result is the formation of large folded mountains. The classic example is the collision between the Indian plate and the Asia plate.
msmarco_passage_32_480897245	The result is the Himalayan mountains. When two ocean plates meet a deep ocean trench results and parts of both plates are destroyed. Arcs of Ocean islands (often volcanic) are created by the collision. When ever, where ever two plates converge a convergent boundary results.
msmarco_passage_32_584547635	The famous San Andreas Fault in California is example of a transform plate boundary. a transform plate boundary forms where two plates slide past each other. As they move past each other, the plate can get stuck and stop moving. stress builds up where the plates are “stuck.”.
msmarco_passage_33_128698323	Some plates run into each other. This can have different results based on which type of plates they are. As oceanic plates (plates under the ocean) run into continental, or other oceanic plates, they typically travel downward into the mantle. When continental plates collide with other continental plates, however, something else happens entirely. Continental collision occurs as two continental tectonic plates run into each other.
msmarco_passage_34_231297503	Two Continental Plates. When two continental plates collide none is subducted as the plates are composed of the same less dense rocks that are kept buoyant. Instead of sinking, the plates wedge up to form mountains.
msmarco_passage_35_174658196	The way one plate moves relative to another determines the type of boundary: spreading, where the two plates move away from each other; subduction, where the two plates move toward each other, with one sliding beneath the other; and transform, where the two plates slide horizontally past each other.
msmarco_passage_35_198020989	When two oceanic plates converge, one plate subducts beneath the other. Generally, two features are formed: a trench, where the oceanic plates at the bottom of the ocean meet, and a volcanic island arc. This is because water being released from the subducting slab facilitates the melting of the overlying mantle.
msmarco_passage_35_380262770	Convergent Boundaries. Convergent boundaries, also known as destructive plate boundaries, a re actively deforming regions where two (or more) plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward each other and collide. When two plates move toward each other, they form either a continental collision or a subduction zone.
msmarco_passage_36_267969153	Transform boundaries do not collide, rather, they slide past each other in opposite directions without pulling apart like divergent boundaries. For example, the San Andreas Fault, which is the source of most earthquakes in San Francisco, is a transform boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.
msmarco_passage_36_296050229	As adjectives the difference between transformative and transformational. is that transformative is that causes transformation while transformational is of, pertaining to or leading to transformation.
msmarco_passage_36_444945944	True: Volcanoes and earthquakes occur at destructive plate boundaries, Earthquakes but NOT volcanoes occur at conservative plate boundaries, Oceanic crust is more dense than continental crust, Continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust, Ocean trenches are formed where oceanic and continental plates collide, Destructive plate boundaries occur where oceanic and continental plates collide, Volcanoes and earthquakes occur at constructive plate boundaries, Earthquakes occur at all types of plate boundary, The subduction zone is where the more dense oceanic crust is driven deep inside the earth, Rocks in the subducted oceanic plate are destroyed when they melt, At a destructive plate boundary, the less dense continental plate crumples to form mountains, At constructive plate boundaries, two plates move apart, At destructive plate boundaries, two plates move together, At conservative plate boundaries, two plates move alongside each other, At constructive plate boundaries, magma rises to fill the gap between the plates, At constructive plate boundaries, cooling magma on the Earth's crust forms new igneous rocks, The mid-Atlantic ridge is an example of a constructive plate boundary, The San Andreas fault is an example of a conservative plate boundary, The Andes mountains were formed at a destructive plate boundary, At conservative plate boundaries, pressure builds where rocks in the two plates become stuck, False: Volcanoes can occur at all plate boundaries, At constructive plate boundaries, two plates move together, At destructive plate boundaries, two plates move apart, At conservative plate boundaries, two plates move apart, The continental plate is more dense than the oceanic plate, At destructive plate boundaries, the continental plate is forced deep inside the Earth, When magma cools at a constructive plate boundary, new sedimentary rocks form, Volcanoes but NOT earthquakes occur at conservative plate boundaries, Convection currents in the Earth's crust drive the movement of the tectonic plates, Most major earthquakes and volcanoes occur well away from plate boundaries,
msmarco_passage_37_769879200	Location. 1st Floor. When oceanic or continental plates slide past each other in opposite directions, or move in the same direction but at different speeds, a transform fault boundary is formed. No new crust is created or subducted, and no volcanoes form, but earthquakes occur along the fault. The transform fault boundaries connect spreading centers and subduction zones, which are the other elements of the jigsaw puzzle of the Earth’s plates.
msmarco_passage_37_769927418	Location. 1st Floor. When oceanic or continental plates slide past each other in opposite directions, or move in the same direction but at different speeds, a transform fault boundary is formed.

The transform fault boundaries connect spreading centers and subduction zones, which are the other elements of the jigsaw puzzle of the Earth’s plates.
msmarco_passage_38_865032892	Volcanoes usually form along plate boundaries, where tectonic plates are either moving towards or away from one another: Constructive boundary (or divergent boundary) - this is where two plates move away from one another. Magma rises up to fill the gaps between the plates usually to create a shield volcano. Destructive boundary (or convergent boundary) - this is where two plates move towards one another.
msmarco_passage_39_313187575	Plates can move past each other in the same plane at a boundary. This type of boundary is called a transform boundary. This type of boundary is dominated by strike-slip faulting although other types of faulting may be observed. Where two plates slide past each other, earthquakes originate at shallow depths.
msmarco_passage_39_313195563	Destructive plate boundary volcanoes. Destructive, or convergent, plate boundaries are where the tectonic plates are moving towards each other. Volcanoes form here in two settings where either oceanic plate descends below another oceanic plate or an oceanic plate descends below a continental plate.
msmarco_passage_40_510111126	Most earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates. They typically occur along fault planes, and most frequently along boundaries of tectonic plates. There are three basic types of plate boundaries — divergent, convergent and transform.
msmarco_passage_43_811249675	The edges, or boundaries, of tectonic plates meet up in different ways. There are three main types of boundaries: transform, convergent, and divergent. At transform boundaries, plates move past each other. This is one of the most common causes of earthquakes. At convergent boundaries, plates move toward each other.
msmarco_passage_44_481556946	Transform Boundaries - A transform boundary is one where two plates slide past each other. These places are often called faults and can be areas where earthquakes often occur. Interesting Facts about Plate Tectonics. One famous transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California.
msmarco_passage_44_583722872	Convergent Boundaries. The convergent boundaries are formed as a result of the plates crashing together. The resultant impact at the time when the two plates collide ends up forming a rugged mountain range and at times the edge of one or both plates bends the other down into a deep seafloor trench.
msmarco_passage_44_586545035	Divergent plate boundaries are where two plates are moving apart and new crust forms as magma rises up to the surface and solidifies, such as at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Transform boundaries, where plates slide past one another, occur in places such as the West Coast of North America along the San Andreas Fault.
msmarco_passage_44_587206698	Transform Margin. Transform margins mark slip-sliding plates, such as California's San Andreas fault. The San Andreas fault marks the location where the North America and Pacific plates grind past each other in a horizontal motion.
msmarco_passage_45_264585643	Plate tectonic boundaries are regions where the edges of lithospheric plates meet. There are three types of plate tectonic boundary, namely, divergent, convergent, and transform. Divergent boundaries describe areas under tension where plates are pushed apart by magma upwelling from the mantle.
msmarco_passage_45_349455569	The sinking crust makes oceanic trenches which are very deep areas within the ocean. I have described a subduction boundary in the previous example. A collision boundary is where two continental plates move toward one another and the force and pressure build up causing the plates to buckle and form a mountain range.
msmarco_passage_45_349456027	In a diverging boundary, two plates move apart. This occurs on the sea floor and is known as sea floor spreading. Magma will rise up and fill in the gap as the two plates separate. This forms a mid-ocean ridge. Another boundary is called a transform boundary where two plates slide past one another.
msmarco_passage_45_350340823	During their motion, these plates interact with each other at plate boundaries. There are three types of tectonic plate boundaries: divergent boundaries, convergent boundaries and transform boundaries.
msmarco_passage_45_765674779	This means two fault blocks are moving past each other horizontally. Strike-slip faults tend to occur along the boundaries of plates that are sliding past each other. This is the case for the San Andreas, which runs along the boundary of the Pacific and North American plates.
msmarco_passage_47_461155358	Divergent Boundaries. In some areas, crustal plates are moving away from each other. This is called divergence . At divergent plate boundaries the slow separation of the plates creates a small space through which magma rises and cools, creating or constructing new crust.
msmarco_passage_47_463744968	Transform boundaries (Conservative) Transform plate boundaries. Two plates sliding past each other, Natural or human-made structures that cross a transform boundary are offset—split into pieces and carried in opposite directions.
msmarco_passage_47_463747303	Convergent boundaries: where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. Transform boundaries: where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other. Plate boundary zones: broad belts in which boundaries are not well defined and the effects of plate interaction are unclear.
msmarco_passage_47_554626035	Convergent Plate Boundaries: where plates move toward each other. Divergent Plate boundaries: where plates move away from each other. Transform Plate Boundaries: where plates slide past one another. Contents [ hide] Convergent Plate Boundaries. Divergent Plate Boundaries.
msmarco_passage_47_620323947	There are three main types of plate boundaries: 1. Convergent boundaries: where two plates are colliding. Subduction zones occur when one or both of the tectonic plates are composed of oceanic crust. The denser plate is subducted underneath the less dense plate.
msmarco_passage_51_719101125	Transform boundaries. At transform boundaries, two plates slide against each other as they move past in different directions. As they slide past each other, neither one is destroyed or pushed. The movement causes energy to build up, which may be released as earthquakes.
msmarco_passage_51_725824341	Fault zone of a transform boundary. A transform boundary is a fault zone where two plates slide past each other horizontally. Most transform faults are found in the ocean where they offset spreading ridges creating a zigzag pattern between the plates. Look at the Antarctic Plate in the map below.
msmarco_passage_51_725826545	The zigzag lines are transform fault zones on the seafloor. Transform plate boundary. Some transform faults form when two plates slide past each other horizontally forming a transform plate boundary. The most famous transform fault plate boundary is the San Andreas Fault which connects the East Pacific Rise and the Juan de Fuca Plate.
msmarco_passage_52_619223213	There are three ways in which plate boundaries meet, and each one triggers a unique geological feature: Convergent boundaries occur where plates collide into one another. Where those plates meet, Earth's crust crumbles and buckles into mountain ranges.
msmarco_passage_54_853415404	Sometimes the plates that move in the mantle layer crash together, move apart or slide next to each other. Convergent Boundaries. A convergent plate boundary is formed by tectonic plates crashing into each other. At these boundaries, the heavier plate can slip under the lighter plate.
msmarco_passage_54_856532365	Noun. boundary between two tectonic plates, where the plates are moving horizontally or vertically in opposite directions, not against or away from each other. Also called a conservative plate boundary. trench. Noun. long, deep depression, either natural or man-made. volcano.
msmarco_passage_55_657538302	Transform Plate Boundaries in Parks. At transform plate boundaries plates grind past each other side by side. This type of boundary separates the North American plate from the Pacific plate along the San Andreas fault, a famous transform plate boundary that’s responsible for many of California’s earthquakes.
msmarco_passage_55_657542914	San Andreas Transform Plate Boundary. The Pacific Plate slides north-northwestward past the North American Plate along the San Andreas Transform Plate Boundary. The San Andreas Fault is responsible for most of the movement in western California, causing a sliver of the state to slide past the rest of the continent.
msmarco_passage_55_657553371	Introduction. Where tectonic plates slip horizontally past one another, lithosphere is neither created nor destroyed. Instead, blocks of crust are torn apart in a broad zone of shearing between the two plates. Such boundaries are called transform plate boundaries because they connect other plate boundaries in various combinations, transforming the site of plate motion.
msmarco_passage_57_630875214	The convergent boundaries: These occurwhen two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. The Transform boundaries: They occur when the lithosphere plates slide and grind against each other, where they result in the destruction or creation of another plate.
msmarco_passage_57_632232213	Driving down to Knowledge town. Noah , Chauffer, LA. Answered Dec 16, 2020. When oceanic or continental plates glide past each other in differing directions or move in the same direction, but at separate speeds, a transform fault boundary is formed. No new crust is generated or subducted, and no new volcanoes form.
msmarco_passage_57_831267725	A break or crack in Earth's lithosphere along which the rocks move. A plate boundary where two plates move past each other in opposite direction. A plate boundary where two plates move away from each other. A deep valley that forms where two plates move apart. A plate boundary where two plates move toward each other.

msmarco_passage_58_394605707	As most everyone knows now, the earth's crust is broken into plates that move around relative to each other. As a result of this movement, three types of plate boundaries are formed: divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries. A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other.
msmarco_passage_59_57302356	By Staff Writer Last Updated Apr 4, 2020 8:35:35 PM ET. At divergent boundaries, the Earth's tectonic plates pull apart from each other. This contrasts with convergent boundaries, where the plates are colliding, or converging, with each other. Divergent boundaries exist both on the ocean floor and on land. The Earth has several major tectonic plates, which are sections of unbroken crust.
msmarco_passage_59_59126159	By Staff Writer Last Updated Mar 30, 2020 10:43:46 PM ET. The three types of plate movement are divergent, convergent and transform plate boundaries. Divergent occurs when two tectonic plates move away from the other. A convergent boundary is when two plates collide.
msmarco_passage_59_807777255	Transform Plate Boundary. This i s where plates move sideways past each other. The crust here isn’t destroyed but the movement can still be dangerous if the two plates lock together causing tension and then snap suddenly causing an earthquake. An example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California.
msmarco_passage_60_80480744	Because a transform plate boundary is, by definition, a location where two plates are sliding past each other, the orientation of a transform is approximately (or ideally) parallel with the relative movement direction of the two plates at that location.
msmarco_passage_61_680933437	Plates can (blank) Pull apart, collide, and move past each other. The boundary between two plates that are moving apart is a (blank) Divergent boundary. When ocean plates collide with continental plates,the denser ocean plate (blank) Sinks. The area where a plate decends is a (blank) Subduction zone.
msmarco_passage_62_569094999	Transform boundaries form when two plates move past each other horizontally. The San Andreas Fault is a world famous transform fault. The master fault runs down the state of California from the Mendocino Triangle in the north south to the East Pacific Rise off the coast of Mexico.
msmarco_passage_64_118540069	Convergent boundaries are where the plates collide with one another causing the subduction of one plate beneath the other. Transform boundaries are the final type of plate boundary and at these locations, no new crust is created and none is destroyed. Instead, the plates slide horizontally past one another.
msmarco_passage_64_138475297	Key Takeaways: Convergent Plate Boundaries. • When two tectonic plates move toward each other and collide, they form a convergent plate boundary. • There are three types of convergent plate boundaries: oceanic-oceanic boundaries, oceanic-continental boundaries, and continental-continental boundaries. Each one is unique because of the density of the plates involved.
msmarco_passage_64_204172919	Convergent boundaries are where the plates collide with one another causing the subduction of one plate beneath the other. Transform boundaries are the final type of plate boundary and at these locations, no new crust is created and none is destroyed. Instead, the plates slide horizontally past one another.
msmarco_passage_64_227336706	Convergent boundaries are where the plates collide with one another causing the subduction of one plate beneath the other. Transform boundaries are the final type of plate boundary and at these locations, no new crust is created and none is destroyed. Instead, the plates slide horizontally past one another.
msmarco_passage_65_369944174	These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries. These are known as convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together; divergent boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart; and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Interactions between these plates are what is what is volcanic activity (best exemplified by the “ Pacific Ring of Fire “) as well as mountain-building.
msmarco_passage_65_370897988	The San Andreas fault in North America is perhaps the most popular transform boundary. Transform boundary is also known as transform fault or conservative plate boundary. Movements of the plates are usually just a few centimeters per year.
msmarco_passage_65_371096661	The places where these plates meet are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries occur where plates separate, slide alongside each other or collide into each other. Subduction zones happen where plates collide. When two tectonic plates meet it is like the immovable object meeting the unstoppable force.
msmarco_passage_65_582805089	The San Andreas Fault System, which crosses California from the Salton Sea in the south to Cape Mendocino in the north, is the boundary between the Pacific Plate (that includes the Pacific Ocean) and North American Plate (that includes North America). These two plates are moving horizontally, slowly sliding past one another.
msmarco_passage_66_233593770	Transform boundaries. Most boundaries are either convergent or divergent, but transform boundaries occur in a few places to accommodate lateral motion, where plates move horizontally past one another. This type of boundary is very rare on continents, but they are dramatic where they do occur.
msmarco_passage_66_308163384	Convergent boundaries occur where two plates slide towards each other to form either a subduction zone (if one plate, normally an oceanic plate moves underneath the other) or a continental collision. Subduction zones include the boundaries of the Pacific plate (e.g. Western South America) where the dense oceanic lithosphere sinks beneath the less dense continental plates.
msmarco_passage_66_308174201	Divergent plate boundaries: spreading-center volcanism. Spreading-center volcanism occurs at rift-zones, where two plates are moving apart from each other. Most commonly this is the case at mid-oceanic ridges, where two oceanic plates move apart. The (developing) boundary between two spreading continental plates is known as a continental rift .
msmarco_passage_66_308178818	After all, this process is believed to have separated the continents in the remote past of the earth. At continental spreading boundaries, a continental plate is in the progress of being ripped apart along a so-called rift, a set of parallel fractures that form a graben.
msmarco_passage_68_137481891	Convergent Boundaries. You probably already guessed what type of movement occurs in these boundaries. For those that didn’t, convergent boundaries happen in places where two plates meet. This means they are characterized by two plates moving towards each other.
msmarco_passage_68_137483145	Transform Fault Boundaries And Plate Boundary Zones. Transform fault boundaries are defined by the movement when two plates slide past each other. This movement creates a transform fault or a boundary. These boundaries mostly happen on the ocean floor, although some are known to appear on land.
msmarco_passage_68_68349247	A divergent boundary creates a large ridge that can fill with lava coming up from underneath, which quickly cools and becomes solid. In plate tectonics, a divergent boundary or divergent plate boundary is a linear feature that exists between two tectonic plates that are moving away from each other. One well-known, divergent boundary, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, is a submerged mountain range in the Atlantic Ocean that extends from the Arctic Ocean to beyond the southern tip of Africa.
msmarco_passage_69_21452709	Transform Plate Boundary. Transform plates boundaries unlike convergent boundaries neither create nor destroy lithosphere. Instead, Plates slide past each other in the opposite directions.

msmarco_passage_01_842747026	Lower transaction costs, elimination of exchange rate fluctuations, and price transparency will give incentive for firms to expand their markets within the single currency area. This would also generate investment and employment. A more stable currency. The Euro would be more stable, that is, experiences less exchange rate fluctuations when compared to national currencies because the "value" of Euro reflects the average economic conditions of the whole Union and not that of a single national economy.
msmarco_passage_01_842748674	The stability of Euro is also protected by the explicit stability-oriented monetary policy of European System of Central Banks (ESCB) that controls the value of Euro. Prevent competitive devaluation by nation states. A single currency would prevent the need for nation states in EU to devalue their national currencies to achieve competitive edge over other nation states.
msmarco_passage_01_842750925	Thus, trade and investment are stimulated within this currency union. Reduced Transaction Costs. A single currency would encourage tourisms in the single currency area. A tourist to the European countries in the Euro currency area (12 of them in 2002) would not have to worry about exchanging different currencies and loss in transaction costs (commission and time) as she travel.
msmarco_passage_01_842751459	This also encourage trade across borders in this single currency area. A Euro for example eliminate the extra accounting costs needed to keep tract of different and fluctuating exchange rates among trading partners within the single currency area.

msmarco_passage_00_560159972	Abstract. The transverse tubules (t-tubules) of mammalian cardiac ventricular myocytes are invaginations of the surface membrane. Recent studies have suggested that the structure and function of the t-tubules are more complex than previously believed; in particular, many of the proteins involved in cellular Ca 2+ cycling appear to be concentrated at the t-tubule.
msmarco_passage_00_560160474	Thus, the t-tubules are an important determinant of cardiac cell function, especially as the main site of excitation-contraction coupling, ensuring spatially and temporally synchronous Ca 2+ release throughout the cell.
msmarco_passage_00_560160811	Changes in t-tubule structure and protein expression occur during development and in heart failure, so that changes in the t-tubules may contribute to the functional changes observed in these conditions. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent studies of t-tubule structure and function in cardiac myocytes. The transverse tubules (t-tubules) of mammalian cardiac ventricular myocytes are invaginations of the surface membrane that occur at the Z line and have both transverse and longitudinal elements.

msmarco_passage_00_612808760	Role of calcium in the muscle fiber. In addition to depolarizing the fiber membrane, the action potential travels over the fiber’s network of tubules (T-tubules) to the interior of the cell. The arrival of an electrical charge causes the adjacent SR to release large quantities of stored calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) into the sarcoplasm.
msmarco_passage_00_649131098	When an action potential depolarizes the muscle cell membrane, it also travels into the body of the cell via the t-tubules . The t-tubules are one component of the triads, which are composed of the t-tubule surrounded by the terminal cisternae of two parts of the cell's S.R.
msmarco_passage_00_649667323	The action potential conducts from the surface of the muscle fiber into the interior via transverse tubules ( T tubules ). These long tubes are continuous with the plasma membrane. As a T tubules passes each myofibril, it touches, but is separate from, membranous bags called the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

msmarco_passage_01_139312808	T-tubules are found in both atrial and ventricular cardiac muscle cells ( cardiomyocytes ), in which they develop in the first few weeks of life. They are found in ventricular muscle cells in most species, and in atrial muscle cells from large mammals. In cardiac muscle cells, T-tubules are between 20 and 450 nanometers in diameter and are usually located in regions called Z-discs where the actin filaments anchor within the cell.
msmarco_passage_01_139313764	In skeletal muscle cells, T-tubules are between 20 and 40 nm in diameter and are typically located either side of the myosin strip, at the junction of overlap between the A and I bands. T-tubules in skeletal muscle are associated with two terminal cisternae, known as a triad.
msmarco_passage_01_139314525	Excitation-contraction coupling. See also: Excitation-contraction coupling. T-tubules are an important link in the chain from electrical excitation of a cell to its subsequent contraction (excitation-contraction coupling).
msmarco_passage_01_139315336	Activation of the L-type calcium channel allows calcium to pass into the cell. T-tubules contain a higher concentration of L-type calcium channels than the rest of the sarcolemma and therefore the majority of the calcium that enters the cell occurs via T-tubules.
msmarco_passage_01_139315728	The importance of T-tubules is not solely due to their concentration of L-type calcium channels, but lies also within their ability to synchronise calcium release within the cell. The rapid spread of the action potential along the T-tubule network activates all of the L-type calcium channels near-simultaneously.
msmarco_passage_01_139316599	As the T-tubules are the primary location for excitation-contraction coupling, the ion channels and proteins involved in this process are concentrated here - there are 3 times as many L-type calcium channels located within the T-tubule membrane compared to the rest of the sarcolemma.
msmarco_passage_01_139317000	However, due to the importance of the ions within the T-tubules (particularly calcium in cardiac muscle), it is very important that these concentrations remain relatively constant. As the T-tubules are very thin, they essentially trap the ions.
msmarco_passage_01_139317373	Therefore, even if the concentration of calcium outside the cell falls ( hypocalcaemia ), the concentration of calcium within the T-tubule remains relatively constant, allowing cardiac contraction to continue. As well as T-tubules being a site for calcium entry into the cell, they are also a site for calcium removal.
msmarco_passage_01_821618010	Renal tubule is also called the uriniferous tubule. It starts from the glomerulus capsule and ends at the renal papilla. Renal tubule is divided into four parts, namely the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct. Each region has unique role in urine production.
msmarco_passage_01_87185930	Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.
msmarco_passage_02_158591850	The action potential proceeds along the plasma membrane, which invaginates (T-tubules) into the center of the muscle cell. T-tubules run parallel to the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells and voltage-gated calcium channels in the T-tubules contact calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
msmarco_passage_02_158592277	Action potentials in T-tubules open the voltage-gated calcium channels, which induce the calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum to open. This increases the concentration of cytosolic calcium activating muscle contraction.

Adjustments to the concentration of water and salts within the urine takes place mainly in the distal parts of the tubules and in the collecting tubules, by altering the permeability of the membranes of cells lining the nephron walls.
msmarco_passage_02_465570712	At these T-tubules, the sarcolemma is studded with a large number of calcium channels which allow calcium ion exchange at a rate much faster than that of the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscle. The flux of calcium ions into the muscle cells causes stimulates an action potential, which causes the cells to contract.
msmarco_passage_02_566603201	Now the AP travels down transverse tubules (T-tubules) and stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium (Ca+2) into the muscle fiber. Calcium will play an important role within the sarcomere in initiating a muscle contraction (Fig. 2) 6.
msmarco_passage_02_645405631	A cross-bridge forms between actin and the myosin heads triggering contraction. As long as Ca ++ ions remain in the sarcoplasm to bind to troponin, and as long as ATP is available, the muscle fiber will continue to shorten. Muscle contraction usually stops when signaling from the motor neuron ends, which repolarizes the sarcolemma and T-tubules, and closes the voltage-gated calcium channels in the SR.
msmarco_passage_02_675313902	Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.
msmarco_passage_02_675494143	The action potential spreads through the muscle fiber's network of T tubules, depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fiber. The depolarization activates voltage-gated calcium channels in the T tubule membrane, which are in close proximity to calcium-release channels in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum.
msmarco_passage_03_170142802	The Role of PTH in the Regulation of Calcium. It's important to know that a hormone in your body, called parathyroid hormone, or PTH for short, plays a role in the distal and proximal convoluted tubules. Recall that the majority of calcium is reabsorbed, through passive means, in the proximal convoluted tubule.
msmarco_passage_04_171357368	What is the correct sequence that occurs during the excitation and contraction of a muscle cell? Excitation begins as a motor neuron transmits an action potential to the neuromuscular junction where it gets propagated along the muscle cell. This action potential is an electrical impulse that depolarizes the muscle cell membrane, the sarcolemma, which then releases ions in the sacroplasmic reticulum and transverse tubules.
msmarco_passage_04_195333599	Cardiac muscle cells are similar because they have striations which are strands of actin and myosin filaments. They also have mitochondria, transverse tubules, and sarcoplasmic reticulum.Cardiac muscle is different from skeletal muscle in that the muscle is branching, with intercalated dicks at the ends of them, store less calcium, the transverse tubules are larger, and their twitches are longer.
msmarco_passage_04_564118648	The T- tubules contain extracellular fluid, which is high in both calcium and sodium ions.

msmarco_passage_13_70612666	When Marx explicitly discusses human nature, he typically argues that our nature is determined by the nature of the economic system. There is a certain way we behave because we live in a capitalist society as opposed to a communist one or a feudal one.

msmarco_passage_16_115822662	The fourth aspect of alienated labor for Marx can be derived from the fact that we are alienated from our own human nature or essence which is also according to Marx social. So alienation emerges in the relations of production in capitalist society. In the capitalist relations of production we are alienated not just from the product and the process of production but given that we are alienated from our human nature implies that we are also alienated from ourselves and in turn each other.
msmarco_passage_16_115825626	Marx’s theory of alienation can help us understand work and human nature by framing how we examine the two and how they are connected. As Sayer’s analysis showed there are many thoughts on what work is and what it means to us and Marx’s theory offers a refreshing take on how we should perceive work.
msmarco_passage_16_115832942	It is also formed from the reality that workers do not own the means of production and so are forced to sell for survival the one thing they do own, their labor-power, as Marx writes about the worker “his work, therefore, is not voluntary, but coerced, forced labor.” (Simon, p.62).

msmarco_passage_18_687473586	The immense growth of industry has allowed natural science to transform the life of man. Just as Marx earlier established a reciprocal relationship between man and nature, so does he believe that natural science will one day include the science of man and the science of man will include natural science.
msmarco_passage_18_687474409	If all alienation is the alienation of self-consciousness, then actual alienation - alienation in relation to natural objects - is only apparent. Marx instead sees man as an objective, natural being who has real natural objects that correspond to his nature. Marx calls his view "naturalism" and "humanism".
msmarco_passage_18_687474867	For Marx, nature is that which is opposed to man, yet man is himself a part of the system of nature. Man's nature is constituted by his needs and drives, and it is through nature that these essential needs and drives are satisfied. As such, man needs objects that are independent of him to express his objective nature.

msmarco_passage_19_863328013	Communism portal. Philosophy portal. Socialism portal. v. t. e. Some Marxists posit what they deem to be Karl Marx's theory of human nature, which they accord an important place in his critique of capitalism, his conception of communism, and his ' materialist conception of history '. Marx, however, does not refer to human nature as such, but to Gattungswesen, which is generally translated as 'species-being' or 'species-essence'.
msmarco_passage_19_863328647	According to a note from Marx in the Manuscripts of 1844, the term is derived from Ludwig Feuerbach 's philosophy, in which it refers both to the nature of each human and of humanity as a whole.
msmarco_passage_19_863328959	However, in the sixth Theses on Feuerbach (1845), Marx criticizes the traditional conception of human nature as a species which incarnates itself in each individual, instead arguing that human nature is formed by the totality of social relations.
msmarco_passage_19_863330103	Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man [ menschliches Wesen = ‘human nature’]. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations.
msmarco_passage_19_863330863	In Capital, in a footnote critiquing utilitarianism, he says that utilitarians must reckon with 'human nature in general, and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch'. Marx is arguing against an abstract conception of human nature, offering instead an account rooted in sensuous life.
msmarco_passage_19_863331710	In The German Ideology he uses the formulation: 'their needs, consequently their nature'. We can see then, that from Marx's early writing to his later work, he conceives of human nature as composed of 'tendencies', 'drives', 'essential powers', and 'instincts' to act in order to satisfy 'needs' for external objectives.
msmarco_passage_19_863333862	So we can see that, even before we begin to consider the precise character of human nature, 'real, living' humans, 'the activity of man pursuing his aims' is the very building block of Marx's theory of history. Humans act upon the world, changing it and themselves; and in doing so they 'make history'.
msmarco_passage_19_863334298	Human nature and the expansion of the productive forces. It has been held by several writers that it is Marx's conception of human nature which explains the 'development thesis' ( Cohen, 1978) concerning the expansion of the productive forces, which according to Marx, is itself the fundamental driving force of history.
msmarco_passage_19_863336087	Alienation, for Marx, is the estrangement of humans from aspects of their human nature. Since – as we have seen – human nature consists in a particular set of vital drives and tendencies, whose exercise constitutes flourishing, alienation is a condition wherein these drives and tendencies are stunted.

msmarco_passage_26_38304631	Marx believed that animals can only labor for themselves and their immediate needs. Humans on the other hand can plan and labor for others. Free production — to determine, plan, and execute a series of productive actions — is vital to our species being (human nature).

IN HIS article "Marx vs. the myth of human nature," Paul D'Amato--a socialist whom I have the upmost respect for--makes the traditional but categorical mistake of informing his readers that Marx held no static view of human nature.

Marx did not believe, as do many contemporary sociologists and psychologists, that there is no such thing as the nature of man; that man at birth is like a blank sheet of paper, on which the culture writes its text. Quite in contrast to this sociological relativism, Marx started out with the idea that man qua man is a recognizable and ascertainable entity; that man can be defined as man not only biologically, anatomically and physiologically, but also psychologically.
msmarco_passage_53_217836488	Then he is inexhaustible, and can be ever new, while his purely subjective nature has exhausted itself soon and ceases to have anything to say." [33] ".

msmarco_passage_53_217839788	It is of the utmost importance for the understanding of Marx's concept of activity to understand his idea about the relationship between subject and object. Man's senses, as far as they are crude animal senses, have only a restricted meaning.
msmarco_passage_53_217840571	This nature itself is not to be deduced from the principle of utility. Applying this to man, he that would criticize all human acts, movements, relations, etc., by the principle of utility, must first deal with human nature in general, and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch." [22] . It must be noted that this concept of human nature is not, for Marx -- as it was not either for Hegel -an abstraction.
msmarco_passage_53_217842440	It is the essence of man -- in contrast to the various forms of his historical existence -- and, as Marx said, "the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each separate individual." [23] . It must also be stated that this sentence from Capital, written by the "old Marx," shows the continuity of the concept of man's essence ( Wesen) which the young Marx wrote about in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts.
msmarco_passage_53_217842992	It can appropriate all these things for you, can purchase everything; it is the true opulence.

msmarco_passage_53_217844697	The two sides of the relation are raised to a supposed universality; labor as a condition in which everyone is placed, and capital as the acknowledged universality and power of the community.".

msmarco_passage_53_217845934	In bourgeois society, capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.". Here again, Marx follows the thought of Hegel, who understood labor as the "act of man's self-creation.". Labor, to Marx, is an activity, not a commodity.
msmarco_passage_53_217846371	Marx originally called man's function "self-activity," not labor, and spoke of the "abolition of labor" as the aim of socialism. Later, when he differentiated between free and alienated labor, he used the term "emancipation of labor.".
msmarco_passage_53_217847208	Marx's central criticism of capitalism is not the injustice in the distribution of wealth; it is the perversion of labor into forced, alienated, meaningless labor, hence the transformation of man into a "crippled monstrosity.".
msmarco_passage_53_217850259	For Marx the process of alienation is expressed in work and in the division of labor. Work is for him the active relatedness of man to nature, the creation of a new world, including the creation of man himself. (Intellectual activity is of course, for Marx, always work, like manual or artistic activity.) But as private property and the division of labor develop, labor loses its character of being an expression of man's powers; labor and its products assume an existence separate from man, his will and his planning.
msmarco_passage_53_217851755	For Marx the history of mankind is a history of the increasing development of man, and at the same time of increasing alienation. His concept of socialism is the emancipation from alienation, the return of man to himself, his self-realization. Alienation (or "estrangement") means, for Marx, that man does not experience himself as the acting agent in his grasp of the world, but that the world (nature, others, and he himself) remain alien to him.
msmarco_passage_53_217856285	The alienated man, who believes that he has become the master of nature, has become the slave of things and of circumstances, the powerless appendage of a world which is at the same time the frozen expression of his own powers. For Marx, alienation in the process of work, from the product of work and from circumstances, is inseparably connected with alienation from oneself, from one's fellow man and from nature.
msmarco_passage_53_217863157	Indeed, one can understand the concept of socialism only if one understands Marx's distinction between the true needs of man, and the synthetic, artificially produced needs of man. As follows from the whole concept of man, his real needs are rooted in his nature; this distinction between real and false needs is possible only on the basis of a picture of the nature of man and the true human needs rooted in his nature.
msmarco_passage_53_217863706	Man's true needs are those whose fulfillment is necessary for the realization of his essence as a human being. As Marx put it: "The existence of what I truly love is felt by me as a necessity, as a need, without which my essence cannot be fulfilled, satisfied, complete." [93] . Only on the basis of a specific concept of man's nature can Marx make the difference between true and false needs of man.
msmarco_passage_53_217875663	Marx's vision is based on his faith in man, in the inherent and real potentialities of the essence of man which have developed in history. He looked at socialism as the condition of human freedom and creativity, not as in itself constituting the goal of man's life. For Marx, socialism (or communism) is not flight or abstraction from, or loss of the objective world which men have created by the objectification of their faculties.
msmarco_passage_53_217876236	It is not an impoverished return to unnatural, primitive simplicity. It is rather the first real emergence, the genuine actualization of man's nature as something real. Socialism, for Marx, is a society which permits the actualization of man's essence, by overcoming his alienation. It is nothing less than creating the conditions for the truly free, rational, active and independent man; it is the fulfillment of the prophetic aim: the destruction of the idols.
msmarco_passage_53_218457851	The concrete needs of men is the true middle term for Marx between nature and history. The possibility of having needs and satisfying them, that which makes men need-ful creatures, has its explanation in the physical environment of men and the biological structure of his body.
msmarco_passage_53_218744279	Man possesses a human nature; that “human nature,” which is the conception of human being, is found in every man; which means that each man is a particular example of a universal conception, the conception of Man.
msmarco_passage_55_153266579	As an idealist, Berkeley [wiki] believed that nothing is real but minds and their ideas. Ideas do not exist independently of minds. Through a complicated and flawed line of reasoning he concluded that “to be is to be perceived.”. Something exists only if someone has the idea of it.
msmarco_passage_57_288954218	It is the opium of the people (Contribution to Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right). In the above definition Marx has stressed few points about religion which require special emphasis. In his opinion religion has been created by man to meet his own requirements. It is not the opposite.
msmarco_passage_57_288955139	It is like a sedative. Marx calls it opium. Religion helps man to forget the real world. Persons having vested interests use religion for the attainment of their parochial and limited interests. Marx makes all these remarks about religion in the background of the role religion played in all the periods before him.
msmarco_passage_57_288955620	Explaining Marx’s stand on religion Lenin says that religion is one of the forms of spiritual oppression. Religion is a weapon which blunts the sharpness of human intelligence and productive capacity of workers. ADVERTISEMENTS: He further observes that religion teaches man to be submissive and docile.
msmarco_passage_57_288957389	Marx has said that under the influence of religion man has no freedom to implement his full potentialities; he becomes the victim of religious practices. Man’s power and ability are limited and he does not possess the courage to challenge the religious practices according his own reason.
msmarco_passage_57_288957812	Saint-Simon for that reason argued for their progress which would be able to remove the sense of fear and insecurity from the mind of man. We can, therefore, say that Marx’s idea of religion is linked with Saint-Simon’s thought on the same subject.
msmarco_passage_57_288959898	There are two broad aspects of Marx’s concept of religion. The advent and development of religion is due to the ignorance of man to understand the natural phenomena and their incapacity to solve his problems. When these two are overcome the importance and even the existence of religion will be in danger.
msmarco_passage_57_288961620	Religion originated due to the ignorance of man about nature and natural phenomena. Marx, Engels and their adherents have concluded that religion will disappear with the progress of science and the application of science and technology to the development of society.
msmarco_passage_57_288962424	When science will meet all the requirements of society man will no longer resort to religious practices and adhere to religious beliefs and faiths. If the society reaches that stage the need for religion will decline. The impact of the progress of science and scientific knowledge upon religion has another aspect.
msmarco_passage_57_288963781	It is the considered opinion of Marx, which he formed on the basis of study of history, is that man makes religion, but religion does not make man. In other words, religion is the self-consciousness and self feeling of man who has either not yet found himself or has already lost himself again.
msmarco_passage_57_288964652	But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man, the state, and society. Religion is the general theory of that world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in a popular form. It is the fantastic realization of human essence, because the human essence has no true reality.

msmarco_passage_01_808242787	This essay originally appeared in Consorting, newsletter of the Consortium of Vermont Composers.

msmarco_passage_59_208893350	Both of these statements are true and I will explain why: You don't lose weight from exercising because you are "burning" more calories. Instead, the weight loss comes from the balance to insulin, leptin and the increase in skeletal muscle that comes with it.
msmarco_passage_59_208894197	Well, the truth is that Levothyroxine doesn't necessarily increase your metabolism ... at least not in everyone. In this post I'm going to show you exactly why Levothyroxine can cause weight gain and what you can do about it: More... T4 to T3 Conversion Matters... A lot.
msmarco_passage_59_208894633	Before we talk about how Levothyroxine and Synthroid can cause weight gain we need to talk about some basic thyroid physiology. Your thyroid, under the influence of TSH (if working properly), pumps out primarily the thyroid hormone T4. What you need to understand is that T4 is an inactive hormone.
msmarco_passage_59_208895930	Chances are high that you are dealing with 1 or more of them. And in states such as these, your body will turn T4 into reverse T3 as a way to "put on the brakes" and slow down your metabolism and cause symptoms of hypothyroidism. How Levothyroxine Causes weight gain.
msmarco_passage_59_208896340	Most patients not only prefer to take Natural desiccated thyroid (medication that includes T3 hormone) but this medication also results in more weight loss and an improved quality of life. One of the biggest problems with T4 only medication is that your body may NOT be converting it to the active T3 thyroid hormone.
msmarco_passage_59_208898426	When you exercise you are only focusing on about 5-10% of your calories burned and it has little to no impact on your weight overall (this is why most of you who exercise aren't losing weight). If you are not on a high enough dose of thyroid hormone then your body temperature will be lower.
msmarco_passage_59_208899726	Because hypothyroidism is well known to cause a slow heart rate (5) or low pulse. (6) Your resting heart rate is a reflection of your autonomic nervous system which is mediated by norepinephrine and adrenaline. It's also a reflection of your metabolism and your basal metabolic rate.
msmarco_passage_59_208900170	And that is true if you exercise daily and are not overweight at all, but if you do not exercise and you are 20+ pounds overweight your slow heart rate is NOT a good thing. Instead, it is an early indicator that your body is NOT burning an adequate amount of calories per day which may ultimately lead to weight gain.
msmarco_passage_59_208902691	So yes, Levothyroxine can cause weight loss but it needs to be at the right dose and in the right individual. As a quick aside, if your Doctor isn't willing to add T3 or NDT to your regimen then you might be able to get him/her to prescribe Tirosint instead.
msmarco_passage_59_209814690	If you are going to lose weight when you add Synthroid or levothyroxine it will only be a small amount IF the medication is right for you. What's more is that due to other mechanics in your body, the addition of T4 only medications like Synthroid and levothyroxine can actually lead to weight GAIN.
msmarco_passage_59_209817211	Because even if you have hypothyroidism it's NOT likely to cause significant weight loss by itself (6), except for certain circumstances. Studies have shown that even taking suppressive doses of LT4 (levothyroxine) to lower the TSH does NOT result in weight loss.
msmarco_passage_59_210306861	I get this question from many patients in some form and the answer is that yes, it might cause weight loss in some individuals. This is only true if your body has no issues with the conversion process of T4 to T3 and if your problem with levothyroxine was a lack of absorption.
msmarco_passage_59_541272563	Drug Description. Levothyroxine Sodium. (levothyroxine sodium) Anhydrous Injection. WARNING. NOT FOR TREATMENT OF OBESITY OR FOR WEIGHT LOSS.

msmarco_passage_59_541286650	Newborns. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10 - 15 mcg/kg/day. A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg/day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4 - 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment.
msmarco_passage_59_561142678	SIDE EFFECTS. Adverse reactions associated with levothyroxine therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage (see PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE ). They include the following: General: fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating;
msmarco_passage_60_496562755	What are the side effects of allopurinol? Allopurinol would be more likely to cause weight loss than weight gain. Patients report weight loss, nausea and loss of appetite with allopurinol. Possible side effects of allopurinol may include acute gout attack, diarrhea, nausea and skin rash.
msmarco_passage_60_500985374	Stacy Wiegman, PharmD. Pharmacy. Synthroid should never be used to help you lose weight. Normal doses of Synthroid, which will keep your levothyroxine levels in your body within the normal range, will not cause you to lose any weight.
msmarco_passage_60_500985753	Weight loss only occurs if you take excessively high doses of Synthroid, but these doses can cause serious side effects because of too much levothyroxine in the body. These side effects are particularly likely to occur if you are taking weight loss medications that contain sympathomimetic amines, which are commonly found in appetite-suppressants.
msmarco_passage_64_275092533	Since much of the weight gain in hypothyroidism is accumulation in salt and water, when the hypothyroidism is treated one can expect a small (usually less than 10% of body weight) weight loss. As in the treatment with hyperthyroidism, treatment of the abnormal state of hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone results in a return of body weight to what it was before the hypothyroidism developed.
msmarco_passage_65_250560156	The standard Levothyroxine tablets come in 5 strengths of 12.5mcg, 25mcg, 50mcg, 75mcg and 100mcg. You doctor will decide on your starting dose based on the results of your blood test. Most adults start with 50-100mcg every day, but this may be increased every 3-4 weeks until your thyroxine levels are correct.
